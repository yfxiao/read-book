    In 1982, William T. Reeves, a researcher at Lucasfilm Ltd., was working on
    the film <em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em>. Much of the movie
    revolves around the Genesis Device, a torpedo that when shot at a barren,
    lifeless planet has the ability to reorganize matter and create a habitable
    world for colonization. During the sequence, a wall of fire ripples over the
    planet while it is being “terraformed.” The term <strong><em>particle system</em></strong>, an
    incredibly common and useful technique in computer graphics, was coined in the creation of this
    particular effect.

  <blockquote>
    “A particle system is a collection of many many minute particles that
    together represent a fuzzy object. Over a period of time, particles are
    generated into a system, move and change from within the system, and die
    from the system.”

  <p>
    Since the early 1980s, particle systems have been used in countless video
    games, animations, digital art pieces, and installations to model various
    irregular types of natural phenomena, such as fire, smoke, waterfalls, fog,
    grass, bubbles, and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    This chapter will be dedicated to looking at implementation strategies for
    coding a particle system. How do we organize our code? Where do we store
    information related to individual particles versus information related to
    the system as a whole? The examples we’ll look at will focus on managing the
    data associated with a particle system. They’ll use simple shapes for the
    particles and apply only the most basic behaviors (such as gravity).
    However, by using this framework and building in more interesting ways to
    render the particles and compute behaviors, you can achieve a variety of
    effects.

    <h2>4.1 Why We Need Particle Systems</h2>

    <a data-primary="particle systems" data-secondary="purpose of" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      We’ve defined a particle system to be a collection of independent objects,
      often represented by a simple shape or dot. Why does this matter?
      Certainly, the prospect of modeling some of the phenomena we listed
      (explosions!) is attractive and potentially useful. But really, there’s an
      even better reason for us to concern ourselves with particle systems. If
      we want to get anywhere in this nature of code life, we’re going to need
      to work with systems of <em>many</em> things. We’re going to want to look
      at balls bouncing, birds flocking, ecosystems evolving, all sorts of
      things in plural.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just about every chapter after this one is going to need to deal with a
      list of objects. Yes, we’ve done this with an array in some of our first
      vector and forces examples. But we need to go where no array has gone
      before.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, we’re going to want to deal with flexible quantities of elements.
      Sometimes we’ll have zero things, sometimes one thing, sometimes ten
      things, and sometimes ten thousand things. Second, we’re going to want to
      take a more sophisticated object-oriented approach. Instead of simply
      writing a class to describe a single particle, we’re also going to want to
      write a class that describes the collection of particles—the particle
      system itself. The goal here is to be able to write a main program that
      looks like the following:
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
// Ah, isn’t this main program so simple and lovely?
let ps;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(640, 360);
  ps = new ParticleSystem();
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  ps.run();
}</pre>

    <p>
      No single particle is ever referenced in the above code, yet the result
      will be full of particles flying all over the screen. Getting used to
      writing p5 sketches with multiple classes, and classes that keep lists of
      instances of other classes, will prove very useful as we get to more
      advanced chapters in this book.
    </p>

    <a data-primary="inheritance" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="object-oriented programming" data-secondary="inheritance"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="object-oriented programming" data-secondary="polymorphism"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="polymorphism" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Finally, working with particle systems is also a good excuse for us to
      tackle two other advanced object-oriented programming techniques:
      inheritance and polymorphism. With the examples we’ve seen up until now,
      we’ve always had an array of a single type of object, like "movers" or
      “oscillators.” With inheritance (and polymorphism), we’ll learn a
      convenient way to store a single list that contains objects of different
      types. This way, a particle system need not only be a system of a single
      type of particle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Though it may seem obvious to you, I’d also like to point out that these
      are typical implementations of particle systems, and that’s where we will
      begin in this chapter. However, the fact that the particles in this
      chapter look or behave a certain way should not limit your imagination.
      Just because particle systems tend to look sparkly, fly forward, and fall
      with gravity doesn’t mean that those are the characteristics yours should
      have.
    </p>

    <p>
      The focus here is really just how to keep track of a system of many
      elements. What those elements do and how those elements look is up to you.

    <h2>4.2 A Single Particle</h2>

    <a data-primary="particle systems" data-secondary="particles in" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="particles" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Before we can get rolling on the system itself, we have to write the class
      that will describe a single particle. The good news: we’ve done this
      already. Our <code>Mover</code> class from Chapter 2 serves as the perfect
      template. For us, a particle is an independent body that moves about the
      screen. It has <code>position</code>, <code>velocity</code>, and
      <code>acceleration</code>, a constructor to initialize those variables,
      and functions to <code>display()</code> itself and
      <code>update()</code> its position.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Particle {
  //{!3} A “Particle” object is just another name for our “Mover.” It has position, velocity, and acceleration.
  Particle(l) {
    this.position = l.copy();
    this.acceleration = createVector();
    this.velocity = createVector();
  }

  update() {
    this.velocity.add(this.acceleration);
    this.position.add(this.velocity);
  }

  display() {
    stroke(0);
    fill(175);
    ellipse(this.position.x, this.position.y, 8, 8);
  }
}</pre>

    <p>
      This is about as simple as a particle can get. From here, we could take
      our particle in several directions. We could add an
      <code>applyForce()</code> function to affect the particle’s behavior
      (we’ll do precisely this in a future example). We could add variables to
      describe color and shape, or reference a <code>p5.Image</code> to draw the
      particle. For now, however, let’s focus on adding just one additional
      detail: <strong><em>lifespan</em></strong>.
    </p>

    <a data-primary="emitter" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="particle systems" data-secondary="emitter" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="particle systems" data-secondary="lifespan of particles"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="particles" data-secondary="lifespan of" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Typical particle systems involve something called an
      <strong><em>emitter</em></strong>. The emitter is the source of the particles and controls the
      initial
      settings for the particles, position, velocity, etc. An emitter might emit
      a single burst of particles, or a continuous stream of particles, or both.
      The point is that for a typical implementation such as this, a particle is
      born at the emitter but does not live forever. If it were to live forever,
      our p5 sketch would eventually grind to a halt as the number of particles
      increases to an unwieldy number over time. As new particles are born, we
      need old particles to die. This creates the illusion of an infinite stream
      of particles, and the performance of our program does not suffer. There
      are many different ways to decide when a particle dies. For example, it
      could come into contact with another object, or it could simply leave the
      screen. For our first <code>Particle</code> class, however, we’re simply
      going to add a <code>lifespan</code> variable. The timer will start at 255
      and count down to 0, when the particle will be considered “dead.” And so
      we expand the <code>Particle</code> class as follows:
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Particle {

  constructor(l) {
    this.position = l.copy();
    this.acceleration = createVector();
    this.velocity = createVector();
    //{!1 .bold} A new variable to keep track of how long the particle has been “alive”. We start at 255 and count down for convenience
    this.lifespan = 255;
  }

  update() {
    this.velocity.add(this.acceleration);
    this.position.add(this.velocity);
    //{!1 .bold}  Lifespan decreases
    this.lifespan -= 2.0;
  }

  display() {
    //{!2 .bold}  Since our life ranges from 255 to 0 we can use it for alpha
    stroke(0, this.lifespan);
    fill(175, this.lifespan);
    ellipse(this.position.x, this.position.y, 8, 8);
  }
}</pre>

    <p>
      The reason we chose to start the lifespan at 255 and count down to 0 is
      for convenience. With those values, we can assign <code>lifespan</code> to
      act as the alpha transparency for the ellipse as well. When the particle
      is “dead” it will also have faded away onscreen.
    </p>

    <a data-primary="particle systems" data-secondary="dead particles" data-tertiary="checking for"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="particles" data-secondary="death" data-tertiary="checking for"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      With the addition of the <code>lifespan</code> variable, we’ll also need
      one additional function—a function that can be queried (for a true or
      false answer) as to whether the particle is alive or dead. This will come
      in handy when we are writing the <code>ParticleSystem</code> class, whose
      task will be to manage the list of particles themselves. Writing this
      function is pretty easy; we just need to check and see if the value of
      <code>lifespan</code> is less than 0. If it is we
      <code>return true</code>, if not we <code>return false</code>.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  isDead() {
    //{!4} Is the particle still alive?
    if (this.lifespan < 0.0) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }</pre>

    <a data-primary="particles" data-secondary="testing" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Before we get to the next step of making many particles, it’s worth taking
      a moment to make sure our particle works correctly and create a sketch
      with one single <code>Particle</code> object. Here is the full code below,
      with two small additions. We add a convenience function called
      <code>run()</code> that simply calls both <code>update()</code> and
      <code>display()</code> for us. In addition, we give the particle a random
      initial velocity as well as a downward acceleration (to simulate gravity).

      We will use the wonderful javascript array to hold our
      <code>Particle</code> objects. Some particle systems might have a fixed
      number of particles, and arrays are magnificently efficient in those
      instances. p5 also offers <code>append()</code>, <code>shorten()</code>,
      <code>subset()</code>, <code>splice()</code>, and other methods for
      resizing arrays. However, for these examples, we’re going to take a more
      plain javascript approach and use the methods directly available in the
      javascipt class <code>Array</code>.

    <p>
      This last <code>for</code> loop looks pretty similar to our code that
      looped through a regular array by accessing each index. We initialize a
      variable called <code>i</code> to 0 and count up by 1, accessing each
      element of the <code>Array</code> until we get to the end. However, this
      is a good time to mention the "<code>for of</code> loop” javascript, which
      is a bit more concise. The "for of" loop works with arrays like this:
    </p>

    <a data-primary="for of loops" data-secondary="enhanced" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
let particles = [];

for(let p of particles){
  p.run();
}

</pre>

    <p>
      Let’s translate that. Say “for each” instead of “for” and say “in” instead
      of “of”. Now you have:
    </p>

    <p>“For each Particle p in particles, run that Particle p!”</p>

    <p>
      I know. You cannot contain your excitement. I can’t. I know it’s not
      necessary, but I just have to type that again.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
// This for of loop also works for regular arrays!
for (let p of particles) {
  p.run();
}</pre>

    <p>
      Simple, elegant, concise, lovely. Take a moment. Breathe. I have some bad
      news. Yes, we love that "for of" loop and we will get to use it. But not
      right now. Our particle system examples will require a feature that makes
      using that loop impossible. Let’s continue.
    </p>

    <a data-primary="ArrayList class (Java)" data-secondary="resizability of"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      The code we’ve written above doesn’t take advantage of the
      <code>ArrayList</code><code>’s</code> resizability, and it uses a fixed
      size of 10. We need to design an example that fits with our particle
      system scenario, where we emit a continuous stream of
      <code>Particle</code> objects, adding one new particle with each cycle
      through <code>draw()</code>. We’ll skip rehashing the
      <code>Particle</code> class code here, as it doesn’t need to change.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
let particles = [];

function setup() {
  createCanvas(640, 360);

}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  //{!1 .offset-top} A new Particle object is added to the array every cycle through draw().
  particles.push(new Particle(createCanvas(width/2, 50)));

  for (let i = 0; i < particles.length; i++) {
    const p = particles[i];
    p.run();
  }
}</pre>

    <p>
      Run the above code for a few minutes and you’ll start to see the frame
      rate slow down further and further until the program grinds to a halt (my
      tests yielded horrific performance after fifteen minutes). The issue of
      course is that we are creating more and more particles without removing
      any.
    </p>

    <a data-primary="remove() function (ArrayList class)" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Fortunately, we can remove particles from our array using the index
      position of the particle of interest. This is why we cannot use the new
      enhanced <code>for of</code> loop we just learned; the enhanced loop
      provides no means for deleting elements while iterating. Here, we can use
      the <code>Array</code> class's <code>.filter()</code> function. The
      <code>.filter()</code> function checks each item in the specified array
      and removes the item(s) where the given condition is true. In this case,
      the <code>.filter()</code> function will return the array whose particle’s
      <code>isDead()</code> function returns false.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  for (let i = 0; i < particles.length; i++) {
    const p = particles[i];
    p.run();
  }

  // Filter removes any elements of the array that do not pass the test
  // I am also using ES6 arrow snytax
  // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions
  // https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrYMzpbFz18
  particles = particles.filter(particle => !particle.isDead());
  </pre>

    <p>
      Although the above code will run just fine (and the program will never
      grind to a halt), we have opened up a medium-sized can of worms. Whenever
      we manipulate the contents of a list while iterating through that very
      list, we can get ourselves into trouble. Take, for example, the following
      code.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  for (let i = 0; i < particles.length; i++) {
    const p = particles[i];
    p.run();
    //{!1 .offset-top} Adding a new Particle to the list while iterating?
    particles.push(new Particle(createVector(width/2, 50)));
  }</pre>

    <a data-primary="size() function (ArrayList class)" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      This is a somewhat extreme example (with flawed logic), but it proves the
      point. In the above case, for each particle in the list, we add a new
      particle to the list (manipulating the <code>length</code> of the
      <code>Array</code>). This will result in an infinite loop, as
      <code>i</code> can never increment past the size of the
      <code>Array</code>.
    </p>

    <a data-primary="iterating" data-secondary="removing elements in for loops"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      While removing elements from the <code>ArrayList</code> during a loop
      doesn’t cause the program to crash (as it does with adding), the problem
      is almost more insidious in that it leaves no evidence. To discover the
      problem we must first establish an important fact. When an object is
      removed from the <code>Array</code>, all elements are shifted one spot
      to the left. Note the diagram below where particle C (index 2) is removed.
      Particles A and B keep the same index, while particles D and E shift from
      3 and 4 to 2 and 3, respectively.

      <span class="formula">when i = 2 &rarr; Check particle C &rarr; Delete!</span><br />
      <span class="formula2">Slide particles D and E back from slots 3 and 4 to 2 and 3</span><br />
      <span class="formula">when i = 3 &rarr; Check particle E &rarr; Do not delete</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice the problem? We never checked particle D! When C was deleted from
      slot #2, D moved into slot #2, but i has already moved on to slot # 3.
      This is not a disaster, since particle D will get checked the next time
      around. Still, the expectation is that we are writing code to iterate
      through every single element of the <code>Array</code>. Skipping an
      element is unacceptable.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two solutions to this problem. The first solution is to simply
      iterate through the <code>Array</code> backwards. If you are sliding
      elements from right to left as elements are removed, it’s impossible to
      skip an element by accident. Here’s how the code would look:
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  //{!1 .bold} Looping through the list backwards
  for (let i = particles.length-1; i >= 0; i--) {
    const p = particles[i];
    p.run();
  }

  particles = particles.filter(particle => !particle.isDead());
  </pre>

    <h2>4.4 The Particle System Class</h2>

    <p>
      OK. Now we’ve done two things. We’ve written a class to describe an
      individual <code>Particle</code> object. We’ve conquered the
      <code>Array</code> and used it to manage a list of many
      <code>Particle</code> objects (with the ability to add and delete at
      will).
    </p>

    <p>
      We could stop here. However, one additional step we can and should take is
      to write a class to describe the list of <code>Particle</code> objects
      itself—the <code>ParticleSystem</code> class. This will allow us to remove
      the bulky logic of looping through all particles from the main tab, as
      well as open up the possibility of having more than one particle system.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you recall the goal we set at the beginning of this chapter, we wanted
      our main javascript file to look like this:
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
//{!1} Just one wee ParticleSystem!
let ps;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(640, 360);
  ps = new ParticleSystem();
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  ps.run();
}</pre>

    <p>
      Let’s take the code from Example 4.2 and review a bit of object-oriented
      programming, looking at how each piece from the main tab can fit into the
      <code>ParticleSystem</code> class.
    </p>

    <table class="code">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Array in the main javascript file</th>
          <th>Array in the ParticleSystem class</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre>
<b>let particles = [];</b>

function setup() {
  createVector(640, 360);

  background(255);

  <b>particles.push(new Particle());</b>

    <b>this.particles.push(new Particle());</b>
  }

  run() {
    <b>for (let i = this.particles.length-1; i >= 0; i--) {
      const p = this.particles[i];
      p.run();
    }

    this.particles = this.particles.filter(particle => !particle.isDead());

      </tbody>

      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      We could also add some new features to the particle system itself. For
      example, it might be useful for the <code>ParticleSystem</code> class to
      keep track of an origin point where particles are made. This fits in with
      the idea of a particle system being an “emitter,” a place where particles
      are born and sent out into the world. The origin point should be
      initialized in the constructor.
    </p>

  }

  addParticle() {
    //{!1 .bold}  The origin is passed to each Particle when it is added.
    this.particles.add(new Particle(this.origin));

    <h2>4.5 A System of Systems</h2>

    <a data-primary="particle systems" data-secondary="multiple systems" data-tertiary="organizing"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Let’s review for a moment where we are. We know how to talk about an
      individual <code>Particle</code> object. We also know how to talk about a
      system of <code>Particle</code> objects, and this we call a “particle
      system.” And we’ve defined a particle system as a collection of
      independent objects. But isn’t a particle system itself an object? If
      that’s the case (which it is), there’s no reason why we couldn’t also have
      a collection of many particle systems, i.e. a system of systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      This line of thinking could of course take us even further, and you might
      lock yourself in a basement for days sketching out a diagram of a system
      of systems of systems of systems of systems of systems. Of systems. After
      all, this is how the world works. An organ is a system of cells, a human
      body is a system of organs, a neighborhood is a system of human bodies, a
      city is a system of neighborhoods, and so on and so forth. While this is
      an interesting road to travel down, it’s a bit beyond where we need to be
      right now. It is, however, quite useful to know how to write a p5 sketch
      that keeps track of many particle systems, each of which keep track of
      many particles. Let’s take the following scenario.
    </p>

    <p>You start with a blank screen.</p>

    <figure class="screenshot" data-p5-sketch="https://editor.p5js.org/embed/BJYldlbOg">
      <img alt="ch04 ex04a" src="chapter04/ch04_ex04a.png" />
      <figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      You click the mouse and generate a particle system at the mouse’s
      position.
    </p>

    <figure class="screenshot" data-p5-sketch="https://editor.p5js.org/embed/S1mDs_7PQ">
      <img alt="ch04 ex04b" src="chapter04/ch04_ex04b.png" />
      <figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Each time you click the mouse, a new particle system is created at the
      mouse’s position.
    </p>

    <figure class="screenshot" data-p5-sketch="https://editor.p5js.org/embed/HJXzkYQP7">
      <img alt="ch04 ex04c" src="chapter04/ch04_ex04c.png" />
      <figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      In Example <a href="#chapter04_example3">4.3</a>, we stored a single
      reference to a <code>ParticleSystem</code> object in the variable
      <code>ps</code>.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
let ps;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(640, 360);
  ps = new ParticleSystem(1, createVector(width/2, 50));
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  ps.run();
  ps.addParticle();
}</pre>

    <p>
      For this new example, what we want to do instead is create an
      <code>Array</code> to keep track of multiple instances of particle
      systems. When the program starts, i.e. in <code>setup()</code>, the
      <code>Array</code> is empty.
    </p>

    <div data-type="example">
      <h5>Example 4.4: System of systems</h5>
    </div>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
//{!1} This time, the type of thing we are putting in the ArrayList is a ParticleSystem itself!
let systems = [];

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 200);
}</pre>

    <p>
      Whenever the mouse is pressed, a new <code>ParticleSystem</code> object is
      created and placed into the <code>Array</code>.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
function mousePressed() {
  systems.push(new ParticleSystem(createVector(mouseX, mouseY)));
}</pre>

    <p>
      And in <code>draw()</code>, instead of referencing a single
      <code>ParticleSystem</code> object, we now look through all the systems in
      the <code>Array</code> and call <code>run()</code> on each of them.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
function draw() {
  background(255);
  //{!4} Since we aren’t deleting elements, we can use the for of loop!

    ps.run();
    ps.addParticle();
  }

    <h2>4.6 Inheritance and Polymorphism: An Introduction</h2>

    <a data-primary="&lt;em&gt;Learning p5&lt;/em&gt; (Shiffman)" data-type="indexterm"></a>

      data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="polymorphism" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      You may have encountered the terms <em>inheritance</em> and
      <em>polymorphism</em> in your programming life before this book. After
      all, they are two of the three fundamental principles behind the theory of
      object-oriented programming (the other being <em>encapsulation</em>). If
      you’ve read other p5 or Java programming books, chances are it’s been
      covered. My beginner text, <em>Learning p5</em>, has close to an entire
      chapter (#22) dedicated to these two topics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, perhaps you’ve only learned about it in the abstract sense and
      never had a reason to really use inheritance and polymorphism. If this is
      true, you’ve come to the right place. Without these two topics, your
      ability to program a variety of particles and particle systems is
      extremely limited. (In the next chapter, we’ll also see how understanding
      these topics will help us to use physics libraries.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine the following. It’s a Saturday morning, you’ve just gone out for a
      lovely jog, had a delicious bowl of cereal, and are sitting quietly at
      your computer with a cup of warm chamomile tea. It’s your old friend So
      and So’s birthday and you’ve decided you’d like to make a greeting card in
      p5. How about some confetti for a birthday? Purple confetti, pink
      confetti, star-shaped confetti, square confetti, fast confetti, fluttery
      confetti, etc. All of these pieces of confetti with different appearances
      and different behaviors explode onto the screen at once.
    </p>

    <p>
      What we’ve got here is clearly a particle system—a collection of
      individual pieces of confetti (i.e. particles). We might be able to
      cleverly design our <code>Particle</code> class to have variables that
      store its color, shape, behavior, etc. And perhaps we initialize the
      values of these variables randomly. But what if your particles are
      drastically different? This could become very messy, having all sorts of
      code for different ways of being a particle in the same class. Well, you
      might consider doing the following:
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class HappyConfetti {

}

class FunConfetti {

}

class WackyConfetti {

}</pre>

    <p>
      This is a nice solution: we have three different classes to describe the
      different kinds of pieces of confetti that could be part of our particle
      system. The <code>ParticleSystem</code> constructor could then have some
      code to pick randomly from the three classes when filling the
      <code>ArrayList</code>. Note that this probabilistic method is the same
      one we employed in our random walk examples in the
      <a href="#intro_section2">Introduction</a>.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class ParticleSystem {
  constructor(num) {
    this.particles = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < num; i++) {
      const r = random(1);
      //{!7} Randomly picking a "kind" of particle
      if (r < 0.33) {
        this.particles.add(new HappyConfetti());
      } else if (r < 0.67) {
        this.particles.add(new FunConfetti());
      } else {
        this.particles.add(new WackyConfetti());
      }
    }
  }</pre>

    <p>
      OK, we now need to pause for a moment. We’ve done nothing wrong. All we
      wanted to do was wish our friend a happy birthday and enjoy writing some
      code. But while the reasoning behind the above approach is quite sound,
      we’ve opened up one major problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Problem #1: Aren’t we going to be copying/pasting a lot of code
        between
        the different “confetti” classes?</span>
    </p>

    <a data-primary="code duplication" data-secondary="inheritance and" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Yes. Even though our kinds of particles are different enough to merit our
      breaking them out into separate classes, there is still a ton of code that
      they will likely share. They’ll all have <code>p5.Vector</code><code>s</code> to keep track of
      position, velocity,
      and acceleration; an
      <code>update()</code> function that implements our motion algorithm; etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is where <strong><em>inheritance</em></strong> comes in. Inheritance
      allows us to write a class that <em>inherits</em> variables and functions
      from another class, all the while implementing its own custom features.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that we understand the problem, let’s look at this concept in a
      bit more detail and then create a particle system example that implements inheritance.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section data-type="sect1" id="chapter04_section7">
    <h2>4.7 Inheritance Basics</h2>

    <p>
      Let’s take a different example, the world of animals: dogs, cats, monkeys,
      pandas, wombats, and sea nettles. We’ll start by programming a
      <code>Dog</code> class. A <code>Dog</code> object will have an age
      variable (an integer), as well as <code>eat()</code>,
      <code>sleep()</code>, and <code>bark()</code> functions.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Dog {

  constructor() {
    // Dogs and cats have the same variables (age) and functions (eat, sleep).
    this.age = 0;
  }

  eat() {
    print("Yum!");
  }

  sleep() {
    print("Zzzzzz");
  }

  //{!3} A unique function for barking.
  bark() {
    print("WOOF");
  }
}</pre>

    <p>Now, let’s move on to cats.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Cat {

  constructor() {
    this.age = 0;
  }

  eat() {
    print("Yum!");
  }

  sleep() {
    print("Zzzzzz");
  }

  meow() {
    print("MEOW!");
  }
}</pre>

    <p>
      As we rewrite the same code for fish, horses, koalas, and lemurs, this
      process will become rather tedious. Instead, let’s develop a generic
      <code>Animal</code> class that can describe any type of animal. All
      animals eat and sleep, after all. We could then say:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A dog is an animal and has all the properties of animals and can do
          all the things animals do. Also, a dog can bark.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A cat is an animal and has all the properties of animals and can do
          all the things animals do. Also, a cat can meow.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <a data-primary="inheritance" data-secondary="subclass" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="inheritance" data-secondary="superclasses" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="subclass" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="superclasses" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Inheritance makes this all possible. With inheritance, classes can inherit
      properties (variables) and functionality (methods) from other classes. A
      <code>Dog</code> class is a child (<strong><em>subclass</em></strong>) of an
      <code>Animal</code> class. Children
      will automatically inherit
      all variables and functions from the parent (<strong><em>superclass</em></strong>), but can
      also include functions
      and variables not found in the parent.
      Like a phylogenetic "tree of life," inheritance follows a tree structure.
      Dogs inherit from mammals, which inherit from animals, etc.

    <p>Here is how the syntax works with inheritance.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
// The Animal class is the parent (or super) class.
class Animal {

  constructor() {
    //{!1} Dog and Cat inherit the variable age.
    this.age = 0;
  }

  //{!7} Dog and Cat inherit the functions eat() and sleep().
  eat() {
    print("Yum!");
  }

  sleep() {
    print("Zzzzzz");
  }
}

//{!1 .bold} The Dog class is the child (or sub) class, indicated by the code "extends Animal".
class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor() {
    //{!1 .bold}  super() executes code found in the parent class.
    super();
  }
  //{!3} We define bark() in the child class, since it isn't part of the parent class.
  bark() {
    print("WOOF!");
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
  meow() {
    print("MEOW!");
  }

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong><em>extends</em></strong> – This keyword is used to indicate a
          parent for the class being defined. Note that classes can only extend
          <em>one</em> class. However, classes can extend classes that extend
          other classes, i.e. <code>Dog extends Animal</code>,
          <code>Terrier extends Dog</code>. Everything is inherited all the way
          down the line.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong><em>super()</em></strong> – This calls the constructor in the
          parent class. In other words, whatever you do in the parent
          constructor, do so in the child constructor as well. Other code can be
          written into the constructor in addition to <code>super()</code>.
          <code>super()</code> can also receive arguments if there is a parent
          constructor defined with matching arguments.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A subclass can be expanded to include additional functions and properties
      beyond what is contained in the superclass. For example, let’s assume that
      a <code>Dog</code> object has a haircolor variable in addition to age,
      which is set randomly in the constructor. The class would now look like
      this:
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Dog extends Animal {

  constructor() {
    super();
    //{!1} A child class can introduce new variables not included in the parent.
    this.haircolor = color(random(255));
  }

  bark() {
    print("WOOF!");
  }
}</pre>

    <a data-primary="inheritance" data-secondary="overriding superclass functions"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="superclasses" data-secondary="overriding functions from"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Note how the parent constructor is called via <code>super()</code>, which
      sets the age to 0, but the haircolor is set inside the
      <code>Dog</code> constructor itself. If a <code>Dog</code> object eats
      differently than a generic <code>Animal</code> object, parent functions
      can be <em>overridden</em> by rewriting the function inside the subclass.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Dog extends Animal {

  constructor() {
     super();
     this.haircolor = color(random(255));
  }

  // A child can override a parent function if necessary.
  eat() {
    //{!1} A Dog's specific eating characteristics
    print("Woof! Woof! Slurp.")
  }

  bark() {
    print("WOOF!");
  }
}</pre>

    <a data-primary="inheritance" data-secondary="adding functionality to superclass objects"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="subclass" data-secondary="adding functionality to superclass objects"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="superclasses" data-secondary="adding functionality within subclasses"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      But what if a dog eats the same way as a generic animal, just with some
      extra functionality? A subclass can both run the code from a parent class
      and incorporate custom code.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Dog extends Animal {

   constructor() {
     super();

    <h2>4.8 Particles with Inheritance</h2>

    <a data-primary="inheritance" data-secondary="implementing" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Now that we’ve had an introduction to the theory of inheritance and its
      syntax, we can develop a working example in p5 based on our
      <code>Particle</code> class.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let’s review a simple <code>Particle</code> implementation, further
      simplified from <a href="#chapter04_example1">Example 4.1</a>:
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Particle {

  Particle(l) {
    this.acceleration = createVector(0, 0.05);
    this.velocity = createVector(random(-1, 1), random(-2, 0));
    this.position = l.copy();
  }

  run() {
    this.update();
    this.display();
  }

  update() {
    this.velocity.add(this.acceleration);
    this.position.add(this.velocity);
  }

  display() {
    fill(0);
    ellipse(this.position.x, this.position.y, 8, 8);
  }
}</pre>

    <p>
      Next, we create a subclass from <code>Particle</code> (let’s call it
      <code>Confetti</code>). It will inherit all the instance variables and
      methods from <code>Particle</code>. We write a new constructor with the
      name <code>Confetti</code> and execute the code from the parent class by
      calling <code>super()</code>.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Confetti extends Particle {

  // We could add variables for only Confetti here.

  constructor(l) {
    super(l);
  }

  // There is no code here because we inherit update() from parent.


  //{!6} Override the display method.
  display() {
    rectMode(CENTER);
    fill(175);
    stroke(0);
    rect(this.position.x, this.position.y, 8, 8);
  }
}</pre>

    <p>
      Let’s make this a bit more sophisticated. Let’s say we want to have the
      <code>Confetti</code> particle rotate as it flies through the air. We
      could, of course, model angular velocity and acceleration as we did in
      Chapter 3. Instead, we’ll try a quick and dirty solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      We know a particle has an <em>x</em> position somewhere between 0 and the
      width of the window. What if we said: when the particle’s
      <em>x</em> position is 0, its rotation should be 0; when its
      <em>x</em> position is equal to the width, its rotation should be equal to
      <code>TWO_PI</code>? Does this ring a bell? Whenever we have a value with
      one range that we want to map to another range, we can use p5’s
      <code>map()</code> function, which we learned about in the
      <a href="#intro_section6">Introduction</a>!
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
const angle = map(this.position.x,0,width,0,TWO_PI);</pre>

    <p>
      And just to give it a bit more spin, we can actually map the angle’s range
      from 0 to <code>TWO_PI</code>*2. Let’s look at how this code fits into the
      <code>display()</code> function.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  display() {
    const theta = map(this.position.x, 0, width, 0, TWO_PI*2);

    rectMode(CENTER);
    fill(0,this.lifespan);
    stroke(0,this.lifespan);
    //{!5} If we rotate() a shape in p5, we need to familiarize ourselves with transformations. For more, visit: http://p5.org/learning/transform2d/
    push();
    translate(this.position.x, this.position.y);
    rotate(theta);
    rect(0, 0, 8, 8);
    pop();
  }</pre>

    <div data-type="exercise" id="chapter04_exercise7">
      <h5>Exercise 4.7</h5>

      <p>
        Instead of using <code>map()</code> to calculate theta, how would you
        model angular velocity and acceleration?
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Now that we have a <code>Confetti</code> subclass that extends our base
      <code>Particle</code> class, we can add these subclasses to our
      <code>ParticleSystem</code> class. We'll see how this works in the next section.

    <a data-primary="forces" data-secondary="particle systems with" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="particle systems" data-secondary="forces and" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      So far in this chapter, we’ve been focusing on structuring our code in an
      object-oriented way to manage a collection of particles. Maybe you
      noticed, or maybe you didn’t, but during this process we unwittingly took
      a couple steps backward from where we were in previous chapters. Let’s
      examine the constructor of our simple <code>Particle</code> class.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  constructor(l) {
    //{!1 .bold} We’re setting acceleration to a constant value!
    this.acceleration = createVector(0,0.05);

    this.velocity = createVector(random(-1, 1), random(-2, 0));
    this.position = l.copy();
    this.lifespan = 255.0;
  }</pre>

    <p>And now let’s look at the <code>update()</code> function.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  update() {
    this.velocity.add(this.acceleration);
    this.position.add(this.velocity);

    [inline]// Where is the line of code to clear acceleration?

    this.lifespan -= 2.0;
  }</pre>

    <p>
      Our <code>Particle</code> class is structured to have a constant
      acceleration, one that never changes. A much better framework would be to
      follow Newton’s second law (F = M* A) and incorporate the force
      accumulation algorithm we worked so hard on in
      <a href="#chapter02_section3">Chapter 2</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Step 1 would be to add in the <code>applyForce()</code> function.
      (Remember, we need to make a copy of the <code>p5.Vector</code> before we
      divide it by mass.)
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  applyForce(force) {
    const f = force.copy();
    f.div(this.mass);
    this.acceleration.add(f);
  }</pre>

    <p>
      Once we have this, we can add in one more line of code to clear the
      acceleration at the end of <code>update()</code>.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
 update() {
   this.velocity.add(this.acceleration);
   this.position.add(this.velocity);
   //{!1} There it is!
   this.acceleration.mult(0);
   this.lifespan -= 2.0;
  }</pre>

    <p>And our <code>Particle</code> class is complete!</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Particle {

  constructor(l) {
    //{!1} We now start with acceleration of 0.
    this.acceleration = createVector(0, 0);
    this.velocity = createVector(random(-1, 1),random(-2, 0));
    this.position = l.copy();
    this.lifespan = 255.0;
    //{!1} We could vary mass for more interesting results.
    this.mass = 1;
  }

  run() {
    this.update();
    this.display();
  }

  // Newton’s second law &amp; force accumulation
  applyForce(force) {
    const f = force.copy();
    f.div(this.mass);
    this.acceleration.add(f);
  }

  // Standard update
  update() {
    this.velocity.add(this.acceleration);
    this.position.add(this.velocity);
    this.acceleration.mult(0);
    this.lifespan -= 2.0;
  }

  // The Particle is a circle.
  display() {
    stroke(255,this.lifespan);
    fill(255,this.lifespan);
    ellipse(this.position.x,this.position.y,8,8);
  }

  //{!7} Should the Particle be deleted?
  isDead() {
    if (this.lifespan < 0.0) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }
}</pre>

    <p>
      Now that the <code>Particle</code> class is completed, we have a very
      important question to ask. Where do we call the
      <code>applyForce()</code> function? Where in the code is it appropriate to
      apply a force to a particle? The truth of the matter is that there’s no
      right or wrong answer; it really depends on the exact functionality and
      goals of a particular p5 sketch. Still, we can create a generic situation
      that would likely apply to most cases and craft a model for applying
      forces to individual particles in a system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let’s consider the following goal: apply a force globally every time
      through <code>draw()</code> to all particles. We’ll pick an easy one for
      now: a force pointing down, like gravity.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
const gravity = createVector(0,0.1);</pre>

    <p>
      We said it should always be applied, i.e. in <code>draw()</code>, so let’s
      take a look at our <code>draw()</code> function as it stands.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
function draw() {
  background(100);
  ps.addParticle();
  ps.run();
}</pre>

    <p>
      Well, it seems that we have a small problem. <code>applyForce()</code> is
      a method written inside the <code>Particle</code> class, but we don’t have
      any reference to the individual particles themselves, only the
      <code>ParticleSystem</code> object: the variable <code>ps</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since we want all particles to receive the force, however, we can decide
      to apply the force to the particle system and let it manage applying the
      force to all the individual particles:
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
function draw() {
  background(100);

  const gravity = createVector(0, 0.1);
  //{!1} Applying a force to the system as a whole
  ps.applyForce(gravity);
  ps.addParticle();
  ps.run();
}</pre>

    <a data-primary="object-oriented programming" data-secondary="maintaining encapsulation"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Of course, if we call a new function on the
      <code>ParticleSystem</code> object in <code>draw()</code>, well, we have
      to write that function in the <code>ParticleSystem</code> class. Let’s
      describe the job that function needs to perform: receive a force as a
      <code>p5.Vector</code> and apply that force to all the particles.
    </p>

    <p>Now in code:</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  applyForce(f) {
    for (let p of this.particles) {
      p.applyForce(f);
    }
  }</pre>

    <p>
      It almost seems silly to write this function. What we’re saying is “apply
      a force to a particle system so that the system can apply that force to
      all of the individual particles.” Nevertheless, it’s really quite
      reasonable. After all, the <code>ParticleSystem</code> object is in charge
      of managing the particles, so if we want to talk to the particles, we’ve
      got to talk to them through their manager. (Also, here’s a chance for the
      enhanced loop since we aren’t deleting particles!)
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is the full example (assuming the existence of the
      <code>Particle</code> class written above; no need to include it again
      since nothing has changed):

      What if we wanted to take this example one step further and add a
      <code>Repeller</code> object—the inverse of the
      <code>Attractor</code> object we covered in
      <a href="#chapter02_section9">Chapter 2</a> that pushes any particles away
      that get close? This requires a bit more sophistication because, unlike
      the gravity force, each force an attractor or repeller exerts on a
      particle must be calculated for each particle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let’s start solving this problem by examining how we would incorporate a
      new <code>Repeller</code> object into our simple particle system plus
      forces example. We’re going to need two major additions to our code:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          A <code>Repeller</code> object (declared, initialized, and displayed).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function that passes the <code>Repeller</code> object into the
          <code>ParticleSystem</code> so that it can apply a force to each
          particle object.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
let ps;
//{!1 .bold} New thing: we declare a Repeller object.
let repeller;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(640,360);
  ps = new ParticleSystem(createVector(width/2, 50));
  //{!1 .bold} New thing: we initialize a Repeller object.
  repeller = new Repeller(width/2 - 20, height/2);
}

function draw() {
  background(100);
  ps.addParticle();

  const gravity = createVector(0,0.1);
  ps.applyForce(gravity);

  //{!1 .bold} New thing: we need a function to apply a force from a repeller.
  ps.applyRepeller(repeller);

  ps.run();
  //{!1 .bold} New thing: we display the Repeller object.
  repeller.display();
}</pre>

    <p>
      Making a <code>Repeller</code> object is quite easy; it’s a duplicate of
      the <code>Attractor</code> class from Chapter 2, Example 2.6 .
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Repeller {

  constructor(x, y)  {
    //{!1 .bold} A Repeller doesn’t move, so you just need position.
    this.position = createVector(x, y);
    this.r = 10;
  }

  display() {
    stroke(255);
    fill(255);
    ellipse(this.position.x, this.position.y, this.r*2, this.r*2);
  }
}</pre>

    <p>
      The more difficult question is, how do we write the
      <code>applyRepeller()</code> function? Instead of passing a
      <code>p5.Vector</code> into a function like we do with
      <code>applyForce()</code>, we’re going to instead pass a
      <code>Repeller</code> object into <code>applyRepeller()</code> and ask
      that function to do the work of calculating the force between the repeller
      and all particles. Let’s look at both of these functions side by side.
    </p>

    <p>
      The functions are almost identical. There are only two differences. One we
      mentioned before—a <code>Repeller</code> object is the argument, not a
      <code>p5.Vector</code>. The second difference is the important one. We must
      calculate a custom <code>p5.Vector</code> force for each and every particle
      and apply that force. How is that force calculated? In a function called
      <code>repel()</code>, which is the inverse of the
      <code>attract()</code> function we wrote for the
      <code>Attractor</code> class.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  // All the same steps we had to calculate an attractive force, only pointing in the opposite direction.
  repel(p) {
    // 1) Get force direction.
    const dir = p5.Vector.sub(this.position,p.position);
    //{!2} 2) Get distance (constrain distance).
    let d = dir.mag();
    d = constrain(d, 5, 100);
    dir.normalize();
    // 3) Calculate magnitude.
    const force = -1 * this.G / (d * d);
    // 4) Make a vector out of direction and magnitude.
    dir.mult(force);
    return dir;
  }</pre>

    <p>
      Notice how throughout this entire process of adding a repeller to the
      environment, we’ve never once considered editing the
      <code>Particle</code> class itself. A particle doesn’t actually have to
      know anything about the details of its environment; it simply needs to
      manage its position, velocity, and acceleration, as well as have the
      ability to receive an external force and act on it.
    </p>

    <p>
      So we can now look at this example in its entirety, again leaving out the
      <code>Particle</code> class, which hasn’t changed.

    <p>
      Even though this book is really about behaviors and algorithms rather than
      computer graphics and design, I don’t think we would be able to live with
      ourselves if we went through a discussion of particle systems and never
      once looked at an example that involves texturing each particle with an
      image. The way you choose to draw a particle is a big part of the puzzle
      in terms of designing certain types of visual effects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let’s try to create a smoke simulation in p5. Take a look at the following
      two images:
    </p>

    <figure class="two-col-borderless" data-p5-sketch="https://editor.p5js.org/embed/SyHBRKmD7">
      <img alt="White circles" src="chapter04/ch04_ex08b.png" />

      <img alt="Fuzzy images with transparency" src="chapter04/ch04_ex08a.png" />
      <figcaption>Fuzzy images with transparency&nbsp;</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Both of these images were generated from identical algorithms. The only
      difference is that a white circle is drawn in image A for each particle
      and a “fuzzy” blob is drawn for each in B.
    </p>

    <p>
      The good news here is that you get a lot of bang for very little buck.
      Before you write any code, however, you’ve got to make your image texture!
      I recommend using PNG format, as p5 will retain the alpha channel (i.e.
      transparency) when drawing the image, which is needed for blending the
      texture as particles layer on top of each other. Once you’ve made your PNG
      and deposited it in your sketch’s “data” folder, you are on your way with
      just a few lines of code.
    </p>

    <a data-primary="image textures" data-secondary="PImage objects (p5)" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="PImage objects (p5)" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="p5" data-secondary="PImage objects" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>First, we’ll need to declare a <code>p5.Image</code> object.</p>

    <div data-type="example">
      <h5>Example 4.8: Image texture particle system</h5>
    </div>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
let img;</pre>

    <p>Load the image in <code>setup()</code>.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
function setup() {
  //{!1} Loading the PNG
  img = loadImage("texture.png");
}</pre>

    <p>
      And when it comes time to draw the particle, we’ll use the image reference
      instead of drawing an ellipse or rectangle.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  årender() {
    imageMode(CENTER);
    //{!1} Note how tint() is the image equivalent of shape’s fill().
    tint(255, this.lifespan);
    image(img, this.position.x, this.position.y);
  }</pre>

    <a data-primary="particle systems" data-secondary="smoke" data-tertiary="modeling"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Incidentally, this smoke example is a nice excuse to revisit the Gaussian
      number distributions from the <a href="#intro_section4">Introduction</a>.
      To make the smoke appear a bit more realistic, we don’t want to launch all
      the particles in a purely random direction. Instead, by creating initial
      velocity vectors mostly around a mean value (with a lower probability of
      outliers), we’ll get an effect that appears less fountain-like and more
      like smoke (or fire).
    </p>

    <p>
      Assuming a <code>Random</code> object called “generator”, we could create
      initial velocities as follows:
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
    const vx = randomGaussian() * 0.3;
    const vy = randomGaussian() * 0.3 - 1.0;
    const vel = createVector(vx, vy);</pre>

    <p>
      Finally, in this example, a wind force is applied to the smoke mapped from
      the mouse’s horizontal position.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
function draw() {
  background(0);

  //{!2} Wind force direction based on mouseX.
  const dx = map(mouseX, 0, width, -0.2, 0.2);
  const wind = createVector(dx, 0);
  ps.applyForce(wind);
  ps.run();
  //{!3} Two particles are added each cycle through draw().
  for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    ps.addParticle();
  }
}</pre>

    <div data-type="exercise" id="chapter04_exercise11">
      <h5>Exercise 4.11</h5>

      <p>
        Try creating your own textures for different types of effects. Can you

    <div data-type="exercise" id="chapter04_exercise12">
      <h5>Exercise 4.12</h5>

      <p>
        Use an array of images and assign each <code>Particle</code> object a
        different image. Even though single images are drawn by multiple
        particles, make sure you don’t call <code>loadImage()</code> any more
        than you need to, i.e. once for each image file.

    <a data-primary="blend modes" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="image textures" data-secondary="blend modes" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Finally, it’s worth noting that there are many different algorithms for
      blending colors in computer graphics. These are often referred to as
      “blend modes.” By default, when we draw something on top of something else
      in p5, we only see the top layer—this is commonly referred to as a
      “normal” blend mode. When the pixels have alpha transparency (as they do
      in the smoke example), p5 uses an alpha compositing algorithm that
      combines a percentage of the background pixels with the new foreground
      pixels based on the alpha values.
    </p>

    <a data-primary="additive blend mode" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="blend modes" data-secondary="additive" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="Hodgin" data-secondary="Robert" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="iTunes visualizer" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="Magnetosphere" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      However, it’s possible to draw using other blend modes, and a much loved
      blend mode for particle systems is “additive.” Additive blending in p5 was
      pioneered by
      <a href="http://roberthodgin.com/">Robert Hodgin</a> in his famous
      particle system and forces exploration, Magnetosphere, which later became
      the iTunes visualizer. For more see:
      <a href="http://roberthodgin.com/magnetosphere-part-2/">Magnetosphere</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additive blending is in fact one of the simplest blend algorithms and
      involves adding the pixel values of one layer to another (capping all
      values at 255 of course). This results in a space-age glow effect due to
      the colors getting brighter and brighter with more layers.

function setup() {
  createCanvas(640, 360);
}</pre>

    <p>
      Then, before you go to draw anything, you set the blend mode using
      <code>blendMode()</code>:
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
function draw() {
  //{!1} Additive blending
  blendMode(ADD);

  // Note that the “glowing” effect of additive

  background(0);

  // All your other particle stuff would go here.
