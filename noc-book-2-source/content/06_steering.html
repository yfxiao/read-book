    Believe it or not, there is a purpose. Well, at least there’s a purpose to
    the first five chapters of this book. We could stop right here; after all,
    we’ve looked at several different ways of modeling motion and simulating
    physics. Angry Birds, here we come!
  </p>

  <p>
    Still, let’s think for a moment. Why are we here? The <em>nature</em> of
    code, right? What have we been designing so far? Inanimate objects. Lifeless
    shapes sitting on our screens that flop around when affected by forces in
    their environment. What if we could breathe life into those shapes? What if
    those shapes could live by their own rules? Can shapes have hopes and dreams
    and fears? This is what we are here in this chapter to do—develop
    <em>autonomous agents</em>.

    <h2>6.1 Forces from Within</h2>

    <a data-primary="forces" data-secondary="autonomous agents and" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      The term <strong><em>autonomous agent</em></strong> generally refers to an
      entity that makes its own choices about how to act in its environment
      without any influence from a leader or global plan. For us, “acting” will
      mean moving. This addition is a significant conceptual leap. Instead of a
      box sitting on a boundary waiting to be pushed by another falling box, we
      are now going to design a box that has the ability and “desire” to leap
      out of the way of that other falling box, if it so chooses. While the
      concept of forces that come from within is a major shift in our design
      thinking, our code base will barely change, as these desires and actions
      are simply that—<em>forces</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are three key components of autonomous agents that we’ll want to keep
      in mind as we build our examples.
    </p>

    <a data-primary="autonomous agents" data-secondary="key components of"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>An autonomous agent has a <em>limited</em> ability to perceive
            environment.</strong>
          It makes sense that a living, breathing being should have an awareness
          of its environment. What does this mean for us, however? As we look at
          examples in this chapter, we will point out programming techniques for
          allowing objects to store references to other objects and therefore
          “perceive” their environment. It’s also crucial that we consider the
          word <em>limited</em> here. Are we designing an all-knowing rectangle
          that flies around a p5 window, aware of everything else in
          that window? Or are we creating a shape that can only examine any
          other object within fifteen pixels of itself? Of course, there is no
          right answer to this question; it all depends. We’ll explore some
          possibilities as we move forward. For a simulation to feel more
          “natural,” however, limitations are a good thing. An insect, for
          example, may only be aware of the sights and smells that immediately
          surround it. For a real-world creature, we could study the exact
          science of these limitations. Luckily for us, we can just make stuff
          up and try it out.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>An autonomous agent processes the information from its environment
            and calculates an action.</strong>
          This will be the easy part for us, as the action is a force. The
          environment might tell the agent that there’s a big scary-looking
          shark swimming right at it, and the action will be a powerful force in
          the opposite direction.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>An autonomous agent has no leader.</strong> This third
          principle is something we care a little less about. After all, if you
          are designing a system where it makes sense to have a leader barking
          commands at various entities, then that’s what you’ll want to
          implement. Nevertheless, many of these examples will have no leader
          for an important reason. As we get to the end of this chapter and
          examine group behaviors, we will look at designing collections of
          autonomous agents that exhibit the properties of complex systems—
          intelligent and structured group dynamics that emerge not from a
          leader, but from the local interactions of the elements themselves.

    <p>
      In the late 1980s, computer scientist
      <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/">Craig Reynolds</a> developed
      algorithmic steering behaviors for animated characters. These behaviors
      allowed individual elements to navigate their digital environments in a
      “lifelike” manner with strategies for fleeing, wandering, arriving,
      pursuing, evading, etc. Used in the case of a single autonomous agent,
      these behaviors are fairly simple to understand and implement. In
      addition, by building a system of multiple characters that steer
      themselves according to simple, locally based rules, surprising levels of
      complexity emerge. The most famous example is Reynolds’s “boids” model for
      “flocking/swarming” behavior.

      Now that we understand the core concepts behind autonomous agents, we can
      begin writing the code. There are many places where we could start.
      Artificial simulations of ant and termite colonies are fantastic
      demonstrations of systems of autonomous agents. (For more on this topic, I
      encourage you to read <em>Turtles, Termites, and Traffic Jams</em> by
      Mitchel Resnick.) However, we want to begin by examining agent behaviors
      that build on the work we’ve done in the first five chapters of this book:
      modeling motion with vectors and driving motion with forces. And so it’s
      time to rename our <code>Mover</code> class that became our
      <code>Particle</code> class once again. This time we are going to call it
      <code>Vehicle</code>.

      In his 1999 paper “Steering Behaviors for Autonomous Characters,” Reynolds

      <h2>Why Vehicle?</h2>

      <p>
        In 1986, Italian neuroscientist and cyberneticist Valentino Braitenberg
        described a series of hypothetical vehicles with simple internal
        structures in his book
        <em>Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology</em>. Braitenberg
        argues that his extraordinarily simple mechanical vehicles manifest
        behaviors such as fear, aggression, love, foresight, and optimism.
        Reynolds took his inspiration from Braitenberg, and we’ll take ours from
        Reynolds.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Reynolds describes the motion of <em>idealized</em> vehicles (idealized
      because we are not concerned with the actual engineering of such vehicles,
      but simply assume that they exist and will respond to our rules) as a
      series of three layers—<strong>Action Selection</strong>,
      <strong>Steering</strong>, and <strong>Locomotion</strong>.
    </p>

    <a data-primary="action selection" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <a data-primary="autonomous agents" data-secondary="steering" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="steering force" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Action Selection.</em></strong> A vehicle has a goal (or
          goals) and can select an action (or a combination of actions) based on
          that goal. This is essentially where we left off with autonomous
          agents. The vehicle takes a look at its environment and calculates an
          action based on a desire: “I see a zombie marching towards me. Since I
          don’t want my brains to be eaten, I’m going to flee from the zombie.”
          The goal is to keep one’s brains and the action is to flee. Reynolds’s
          paper describes many goals and associated actions such as: seek a
          target, avoid an obstacle, and follow a path. In a moment, we’ll start
          building these examples out with p5 code.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Steering.</em></strong> Once an action has been selected,
          the vehicle has to calculate its next move. For us, the next move will
          be a force; more specifically, a steering force. Luckily, Reynolds has
          developed a simple steering force formula that we’ll use throughout
          the examples in this chapter:
          <strong><em>steering force = desired velocity - current velocity</em></strong>. We’ll get
          into the details of this formula and why it works so
          effectively in the next section.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Locomotion.</em></strong> For the most part, we’re going
          to ignore this third layer. In the case of fleeing zombies, the
          locomotion could be described as “left foot, right foot, left foot,
          right foot, as fast as you can.” In our p5 world, however, a
          rectangle or circle or triangle’s actual movement across a window is
          irrelevant given that it’s all an illusion in the first place.
          Nevertheless, this isn’t to say that you should ignore locomotion
          entirely. You will find great value in thinking about the locomotive
          design of your vehicle and how you choose to animate it. The examples
          in this chapter will remain visually bare, and a good exercise would
          be to elaborate on the animation style —could you add spinning wheels
          or oscillating paddles or shuffling legs?

    <a data-primary="locomotion" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Ultimately, the most important layer for you to consider is #1—<em>Action Selection</em>. What
      are the elements of your system and what are their goals? In this
      chapter, we are going to look at a series of steering behaviors (i.e.
      actions): seek, flee, follow a path, follow a flow field, flock with your
      neighbors, etc. It’s important to realize, however, that the point of
      understanding how to write the code for these behaviors is not because you
      should use them in all of your projects. Rather, these are a set of
      building blocks, a foundation from which you can design and develop
      vehicles with creative goals and new and exciting behaviors. And even
      though we will think literally in this chapter (follow that pixel!), you
      should allow yourself to think more abstractly (like Braitenberg). What
      would it mean for your vehicle to have “love” or “fear” as its goal, its
      driving force? Finally (and we’ll address this later in the chapter), you
      won’t get very far by developing simulations with only one action. Yes,
      our first example will be “seek a target.” But for you to be creative—to
      make these steering behaviors <em>your own</em><code>—</code>it will all
      come down to mixing and matching multiple actions within the same vehicle.
      So view these examples not as singular behaviors to be emulated, but as
      pieces of a larger puzzle that you will eventually assemble.

    <h2>6.3 The Steering Force</h2>

    <a data-primary="forces" data-secondary="steering" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      We can entertain ourselves by discussing the theoretical principles behind
      autonomous agents and steering as much as we like, but we can’t get
      anywhere without first understanding the concept of a steering force.
      Consider the following scenario. A vehicle moving with velocity desires to
      seek a target.
    </p>

    <figure class="half-width-right" id="chapter06_figure1">
      <img alt="Figure 6.1" src="chapter06/ch06_01.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.1</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Its goal and subsequent action is to seek the target in Figure 6.1. If you
      think back to Chapter 2, you might begin by making the target an attractor
      and apply a gravitational force that pulls the vehicle to the target. This
      would be a perfectly reasonable solution, but conceptually it’s not what
      we’re looking for here. We don’t want to simply calculate a force that
      pushes the vehicle towards its target; rather, we are asking the vehicle
      to make an intelligent decision to steer towards the target based on its
      perception of its state and environment (i.e. how fast and in what
      direction is it currently moving). The vehicle should look at how it
      desires to move (a vector pointing to the target), compare that goal with
      how quickly it is currently moving (its velocity), and apply a force
      accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>steering force = desired velocity - current velocity</em></strong>
    </p>

    <p>Or as we might write in p5:</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
const steer = p5.Vector.sub(desired, velocity);</pre>

    <a data-primary="desired velocity" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="steering force" data-secondary="desired velocity" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      In the above formula, velocity is no problem. After all, we’ve got a
      variable for that. However, we don’t have the <em>desired velocity</em>;
      this is something we have to calculate. Let’s take a look at Figure 6.2.
      If we’ve defined the vehicle’s goal as “seeking the target,” then its
      desired velocity is a vector that points from its current position to the
      target position.
    </p>

    <figure id="chapter06_figure2">
      <img alt="Figure 6.2" src="chapter06/ch06_02.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.2</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Assuming a <code>p5.Vector</code> target, we then have:</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
const desired = p5.Vector.sub(target, position);</pre>

    <p>
      But this isn’t particularly realistic. What if we have a very
      high-resolution window and the target is thousands of pixels away? Sure,
      the vehicle might desire to teleport itself instantly to the target
      position with a massive velocity, but this won’t make for an effective
      animation. What we really want to say is:
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>The vehicle desires to move towards the target at maximum speed.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      In other words, the vector should point from position to target and with a
      magnitude equal to maximum speed (i.e. the fastest the vehicle can go). So
      first, we need to make sure we add a variable to our
      <code>Vehicle</code> class that stores maximum speed.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Vehicle {

  constructor(){
    this.position = createVector();
    this.velocity = createVector();
    this.acceleration = createVector();
    // Maximum speed
    this.maxspeed = ????;
  }
  </pre>

    <p>
      Then, in our desired velocity calculation, we scale according to maximum
      speed.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
const desired = p5.Vector.sub(target, this.position);
desired.normalize();
desired.mult(this.maxspeed);</pre>

    <figure id="chapter06_figure3">
      <img alt="Figure 6.3" src="chapter06/ch06_03.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.3</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Putting this all together, we can write a function called
      <code>seek()</code> that receives a <code>p5.Vector</code> target and
      calculates a steering force towards that target.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  seek(target) {
    const desired = p5.Vector.sub(target,this.position);
    desired.normalize();
    //{!1} Calculating the desired velocity
    // to target at max speed
    desired.mult(this.maxspeed);

    // Reynolds’s formula for steering force
    const steer = p5.Vector.sub(desired, this.velocity);
    //{!1} Using our physics model and applying the force
    // to the object’s acceleration
    this.applyForce(steer);
  }</pre>

    <p>
      Note how in the above function we finish by passing the steering force
      into <code>applyForce()</code>. This assumes that we are basing this
      example on the foundation we built in
      <a href="#chapter02_section2">Chapter 2</a>. However, you could just as
      easily use the steering force with Box2D’s
      <code>applyForce()</code> function or toxiclibs’
      <code>addForce()</code> function.
    </p>

    <p>
      So why does this all work so well? Let’s see what the steering force looks
      like relative to the vehicle and target positions.
    </p>

    <figure id="chapter06_figure4">
      <img alt="Figure 6.4" src="chapter06/ch06_04.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.4</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Again, notice how this is not at all the same force as gravitational
      attraction. Remember one of our principles of autonomous agents: An
      autonomous agent has a <em>limited</em> ability to perceive its
      environment. Here is that ability, subtly embedded into Reynolds’s
      steering formula. If the vehicle weren’t moving at all (zero velocity),
      desired minus velocity would be equal to desired. But this is not the
      case. The vehicle is aware of its own velocity and its steering force
      compensates accordingly. This creates a more active simulation, as the way
      in which the vehicle moves towards the targets depends on the way it is
      moving in the first place.
    </p>

    <a data-primary="steering force" data-secondary="magnitude of" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      In all of this excitement, however, we’ve missed one last step. What sort
      of vehicle is this? Is it a super sleek race car with amazing handling? Or
      a giant Mack truck that needs a lot of advance notice to turn? A graceful
      panda, or a lumbering elephant? Our example code, as it stands, has no
      feature to account for this variability in steering ability. Steering
      ability can be controlled by limiting the magnitude of the steering force.
      Let’s call that limit the “maximum force” (or <code>maxforce</code> for
      short). And so finally, we have:
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Vehicle {

  constructor(){
    this.position = createVector();
    this.velocity = createVector();
    this.acceleration = createVector();
    // Maximum speed
    this.maxspeed = ????;
    // Now we also have maximum force.
    this.maxforce = ????;
  }
  </pre>

    <p>followed by:</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  seek(target) {
    const desired = p5.Vector.sub(target, this.position);
    desired.normalize();
    desired.mult(this.maxspeed);
    const steer = p5.Vector.sub(desired, this.velocity);

    //{!1} Limit the magnitude of the steering force.
    steer.limit(this.maxforce);

    this.applyForce(steer);
  }</pre>

    <p>
      Limiting the steering force brings up an important point. We must always
      remember that it’s not actually our goal to get the vehicle to the target
      as fast as possible. If that were the case, we would just say “position
      equals target” and there the vehicle would be. Our goal, as Reynolds puts
      it, is to move the vehicle in a “lifelike and improvisational manner.”
      We’re trying to make it appear as if the vehicle is steering its way to
      the target, and so it’s up to us to play with the forces and variables of
      the system to simulate a given behavior. For example, a large maximum
      steering force would result in a very different path than a small one. One
      is not inherently better or worse than the other; it depends on your
      desired effect. (And of course, these values need not be fixed and could
      change based on other conditions. Perhaps a vehicle has health: the higher
      the health, the better it can steer.)

    <h2>6.4 Arriving Behavior</h2>

    <a data-primary="arriving behavior" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="autonomous agents" data-secondary="arriving behavior"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      After working for a bit with the seeking behavior, you probably are asking
      yourself, “What if I want my vehicle to slow down as it approaches the
      target?” Before we can even begin to answer this question, we should look
      at the reasons behind why the seek behavior causes the vehicle to fly past
      the target so that it has to turn around and go back. Let’s consider the
      brain of a seeking vehicle. What is it thinking?
    </p>

    <p>
      Frame 1: I want to go as fast as possible towards the target!<br />
      Frame 2: I want to go as fast as possible towards the target!<br />
      Frame 3: I want to go as fast as possible towards the target!<br />
      Frame 4: I want to go as fast as possible towards the target!<br />
      Frame 5: I want to go as fast as possible towards the target!<br />
      etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      The vehicle is so gosh darn excited about getting to the target that it
      doesn’t bother to make any intelligent decisions about its speed relative
      to the target’s proximity. Whether it’s far away or very close, it always
      wants to go as fast as possible.
    </p>

    <figure id="chapter06_figure6">
      <img alt="Figure 6.6" src="chapter06/ch06_06.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.6</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      In some cases, this is the desired behavior (if a missile is flying at a
      target, it should always travel at maximum speed.) However, in many other
      cases (a car pulling into a parking spot, a bee landing on a flower), the
      vehicle’s thought process needs to consider its speed relative to the
      distance from its target. For example:
    </p>

    <p>
      Frame 1: I’m very far away. I want to go as fast as possible towards the
      target!<br />
      Frame 2: I’m very far away. I want to go as fast as possible towards the
      target!<br />
      Frame 3: I’m somewhat far away. I want to go as fast as possible towards
      the target!<br />
      Frame 4: I’m getting close. I want to go more slowly towards the
      target!<br />
      Frame 5: I’m almost there. I want to go very slowly towards the target!<br />
      Frame 6: I’m there. I want to stop!
    </p>

    <figure id="chapter06_figure7">
      <img alt="Figure 6.7" src="chapter06/ch06_07.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.7</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      How can we implement this “arriving” behavior in code? Let’s return to our
      <code>seek()</code> function and find the line of code where we set the
      magnitude of the desired velocity.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
   const desired = p5.Vector.sub(target, this.position);
   desired.normalize();
   desired.mult(this.maxspeed);</pre>

    <p>
      In Example 6.1, the magnitude of the desired vector is always “maximum”
      speed.
    </p>

    <figure id="chapter06_figure8">
      <img alt="Figure 6.8" src="chapter06/ch06_08.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.8</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      What if we instead said the desired velocity is equal to half the
      distance?
    </p>

    <figure id="chapter06_figure9">
      <img alt="Figure 6.9" src="chapter06/ch06_09.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.9</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
   const desired = p5.Vector.sub(target, this.position);
   desired.div(2);</pre>

    <p>
      While this nicely demonstrates our goal of a desired speed tied to our
      distance from the target, it’s not particularly reasonable. After all, 10
      pixels away is rather close and a desired speed of 5 is rather large.
      Something like a desired velocity with a magnitude of 5% of the distance
      would work much better.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  const desired = p5.Vector.sub(target, this.position);
  desired.mult(0.05);</pre>

    <p>
      Reynolds describes a more sophisticated approach. Let’s imagine a circle
      around the target with a given radius. If the vehicle is within that
      circle, it slows down—at the edge of the circle, its desired speed is
      maximum speed, and at the target itself, its desired speed is 0.
    </p>

    <figure id="chapter06_figure10">
      <img alt="Figure 6.10" src="chapter06/ch06_10.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.10</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      In other words, if the distance from the target is less than r, the
      desired speed is between 0 and maximum speed mapped according to that
      distance.
    </p>

      <h5>Example 6.2: Arrive steering behavior</h5>
    </div>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  arrive(target) {
    const desired = p5.Vector.sub(target,this.position);

    //{!1} The distance is the magnitude of

    const d = desired.mag();
    desired.normalize();
    //{!1} If we are closer than 100 pixels...
    if (d < 100) {
      //{!2} ...set the magnitude
      // according to how close we are.
      const m = map(d, 0, 100, 0, this.maxspeed);
      desired.mult(m);
    } else {
      //{!1} Otherwise, proceed at maximum speed.
      desired.mult(this.maxspeed);
    }

    //{!1} The usual steering = desired - velocity
    const steer = p5.Vector.sub(desired, this.velocity);
    steer.limit(this.maxforce);
    this.applyForce(steer);
  }</pre>

    <p>
      The arrive behavior is a great demonstration of the magic of “desired
      minus velocity.” Let’s examine this model again relative to how we
      calculated forces in earlier chapters. In the “gravitational attraction”
      examples, the force always pointed directly from the object to the target
      (the exact direction of the desired velocity), whether the force was
      strong or weak.
    </p>

    <a data-primary="arriving behavior" data-secondary="steering force and"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="steering force" data-secondary="arriving behavior and"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      The steering function, however, says: “I have the ability to perceive the
      environment.” The force isn’t based on just the desired velocity, but on
      the desired velocity relative to the current velocity. Only things that
      are alive can know their current velocity. A box falling off a table
      doesn’t know it’s falling. A cheetah chasing its prey, however, knows it
      is chasing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The steering force, therefore, is essentially a manifestation of the
      current velocity’s <strong><em>error</em></strong>: "I’m supposed to be going this fast in
      this direction, but I’m actually
      going this fast in another direction. My error is the difference between
      where I want to go and where I am currently going." Taking that error and
      applying it as a steering force results in more dynamic, lifelike
      simulations. With gravitational attraction, you would never have a force
      pointing away from the target, no matter how close. But with arriving via
      steering, if you are moving too fast towards the target, the error would
      actually tell you to slow down!

    <p>
      The first two examples we’ve covered—seek and arrive—boil down to
      calculating a single vector for each behavior: the
      <em>desired</em> velocity. And in fact, every single one of Reynolds’s
      steering behaviors follows this same pattern. In this chapter, we’re going
      to walk through several more of Reynolds’s behaviors—flow field,
      path-following, flocking. First, however, I want to emphasize again that
      these are <em>examples</em>—demonstrations of common steering behaviors
      that are useful in procedural animation. They are not the be-all and
      end-all of what <em>you</em> can do. As long as you can come up with a
      vector that describes a vehicle’s <em>desired</em> velocity, then you have
      created your own steering behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let’s see how Reynolds defines the desired velocity for his wandering
      behavior.
    </p>

    <a data-primary="wandering behavior (Reynolds)" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <blockquote>
      “Wandering is a type of random steering which has some long term order:
      the steering direction on one frame is related to the steering direction
      on the next frame. This produces more interesting motion than, for
      example, simply generating a random steering direction each frame.”

    </figure>

    <a data-primary="steering behaviors" data-secondary="wandering" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      For Reynolds, the goal of wandering is not simply random motion, but
      rather a sense of moving in one direction for a little while, wandering
      off to the next for a little bit, and so on and so forth. So how does
      Reynolds calculate a desired vector to achieve such an effect?
    </p>

    <p>
      Figure 6.12 illustrates how the vehicle predicts its future position as a
      fixed distance in front of it (in the direction of its velocity), draws a
      circle with radius <code>r</code> at that position, and picks a random
      point along the circumference of the circle. That random point moves
      randomly around the circle in each frame of animation. And that random
      point is the vehicle’s target, its desired vector pointing in that
      direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sounds a bit absurd, right? Or, at the very least, rather arbitrary. In
      fact, this is a very clever and thoughtful solution—it uses randomness to
      drive a vehicle’s steering, but constrains that randomness along the path
      of a circle to keep the vehicle’s movement from appearing jittery, and,
      well, random.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the seemingly random and arbitrary nature of this solution should
      drive home the point I’m trying to make—these are made-up behaviors
      inspired by real-life motion. You can just as easily concoct some
      elaborate scenario to compute a desired velocity yourself. And you should.

    <p>
      Let’s say we want to create a steering behavior called “stay within
      walls.” We’ll define the desired velocity as:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>If a vehicle comes within a distance</em></strong> d
      <strong><em>of a wall, it desires to move at maximum speed in the opposite
          direction of the wall.</em></strong>

      If we define the walls of the space as the edges of a p5 window

    <p>
      Now back to the task at hand. Let’s examine a couple more of Reynolds’s
      steering behaviors. First, <strong><em>flow field following</em></strong>. What is a flow
      field? Think of your p5 window as a grid. In
      each cell of the grid lives an arrow pointing in some direction—you know,
      a vector. As a vehicle moves around the screen, it asks, “Hey, what arrow
      is beneath me? That’s my desired velocity!”
    </p>

    <figure id="chapter06_figure14">
      <img alt="Figure 6.14" src="chapter06/ch06_14.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.14</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Reynolds’s flow field following example has the vehicle predicting its
      future position and following the vector at that spot, but for
      simplicity’s sake, we’ll have the vehicle simply look to the vector at its
      current position.
    </p>

    <a data-primary="arrays (2D)" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Before we can write the additional code for our
      <code>Vehicle</code> class, we’ll need to build a class that describes the
      flow field itself, the grid of vectors. A two-dimensional array is a
      convenient data structure in which to store a grid of information. If you
      are not familiar with 2D arrays, I suggest reviewing this online
      p5 tutorial:
      <a href="http://processing.org/learning/2darray/">2D array</a>. The 2D
      array is convenient because we reference each element with two indices,
      which we can think of as columns and rows.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class FlowField {

  constructor(){
    // Resolution of grid relative to window
    // width and height in pixels
    this.resolution = ????;
    // How many columns and how many rows in the grid?
    this.cols = ????;
    this.rows = ????;
    this.resolution = ????;

      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Notice how we are defining a third variable called
      <code>resolution</code> above. What is this variable? Let’s say we have a
      p5 window that is 200 pixels wide by 200 pixels high. We could
      make a flow field that has a <code>p5.Vector</code> object for every single
      pixel, or 40,000 <code>p5.Vector</code><code>s</code> (200 * 200). This
      isn’t terribly unreasonable, but in our case, it’s overkill. We don’t need
      a <code>p5.Vector</code> for every single pixel; we can achieve the same
      effect by having, say, one every ten pixels (20 * 20 = 400). We use this
      resolution to define the number of columns and rows based on the size of
      the window divided by resolution:
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  constructor(){
    this.resolution = 10;
    // Total columns equals width divided by resolution.
    this.cols = width/this.resolution;
    //{!1} Total rows equals height divided by resolution.
    this.rows = height/this.resolution;
    this.resolution = ????;
    // field will be a 2D array of vectors
    this.field = [];

    // create a 2D array out of the field

      this.field[i] = [];
    }
  }
  </pre>

    <p>
      Now that we’ve set up the flow field’s data structures, it’s time to
      compute the vectors in the flow field itself. How do we do that? However
      we feel like it! Perhaps we want to have every vector in the flow field
      pointing to the right.

      Now we’re getting somewhere. Flow fields can be used for simulating

      is one way to achieve such an effect. Of course, there’s no “correct” way
      to calculate the vectors of a flow field; it’s really up to you to decide
      what you’re looking to simulate.
    </p>

      <h5>Exercise 6.6</h5>

      <p>
        Write the code to calculate a <code>p5.Vector</code> at every position in
        the flow field that points towards the center of a window.
      </p>

const v = createVector(____________,____________);
v.______________();
this.field[i][j] = v;</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      Now that we have a two-dimensional array storing all of the flow field
      vectors, we need a way for a vehicle to look up its desired vector in the
      flow field. Let’s say we have a vehicle that lives at a
      <code>p5.Vector</code>: its position. We first need to divide by the
      resolution of the grid. For example, if the resolution is 10 and the
      vehicle is at <em>(100,50)</em>, we need to look up column 10 and row 5.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
const column = int(this.position.x/this.resolution);
const row = int(this.position.y/this.resolution);</pre>

    <a data-primary="constrain() function (Processing)" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Because a vehicle could theoretically wander off the p5 window,
      it’s also useful for us to employ the <code>constrain()</code> function to
      make sure we don’t look outside of the flow field array. Here is a
      function we’ll call <code>lookup()</code> that goes in the
      <code>FlowField</code> class—it receives a
      <code>p5.Vector</code> (presumably the position of our vehicle) and returns
      the corresponding flow field <code>p5.Vector</code> for that position.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  lookup(lookup) {
    //{!2 .offset-top} Using constrain()
    let column = Math.floor(constrain(lookup.x / this.resolution, 0, this.cols - 1));
    let row = Math.floor(constrain(lookup.y / this.resolution, 0, this.rows - 1));

    //{!1} Note the use of copy() to ensure
    // we return a copy of the PVector.
    return this.field[column][row].copy();
  }</pre>

    <p>
      Before we move on to the <code>Vehicle</code> class, let’s take a look at
      the <code>FlowField</code> class all together.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class FlowField {

  constructor(r) {
    this.resolution = r;
    //{!2} Determine the number of columns and rows.
    this.cols = width/this.resolution;
    this.rows = height/this.resolution;
    //{!1} A flow field is a two-dimensional array of PVectors.
    this.field = this.make2Darray(this.cols);
    init();
  }

  // we make a function to create our 2D array
  make2Darray(n) {
    let array = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      array[i] = [];
    }
    return array;
  }

  // we use this init() function to fill our 2D array
  init() {
    // Reseed noise so we get a new flow field every time
    // Need to get noise working
    noiseSeed(Math.floor(random(10000)));
    let xoff = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < this.cols; i++) {
      let yoff = 0;
      for (let j = 0; j < this.rows; j++) {
        //{.code-wide} In this example, we use Perlin noise to seed the vectors.
        let theta = map(noise(xoff, yoff), 0, 1, 0, TWO_PI);
        //let theta = map(sin(xoff)+cos(yoff),-2,2,0,TWO_PI);
        // Polar to cartesian coordinate transformation to get x and y components of the vector
        this.field[i][j] = createVector(cos(theta), sin(theta));
        yoff += 0.1;
      }
      xoff += 0.1;
    }
  }

  //{.code-wide} A function to return a p5.Vector based on a position
  lookup(lookup) {
    let column = Math.floor(constrain(lookup.x / this.resolution, 0, this.cols - 1));
    let row = Math.floor(constrain(lookup.y / this.resolution, 0, this.rows - 1));
    //println(lookup.x);
    return this.field[column][row].copy();
  }

}</pre>

    <p>
      So let’s assume we have a <code>FlowField</code> object called “flow”.
      Using the <code>lookup()</code> function above, our vehicle can then
      retrieve a desired vector from the flow field and use Reynolds’s rules
      (steering = desired - velocity) to calculate a steering force.

    <h2>6.7 The Dot Product</h2>

    <a data-primary="vectors" data-secondary="dot product" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      In a moment, we’re going to work through the algorithm (along with
      accompanying mathematics) and code for another of Craig Reynolds’s
      steering behaviors:
      <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/PathFollow.html">Path Following</a>. Before we can do
      this, however, we have to spend some time learning
      about another piece of vector math that we skipped in Chapter 1—the dot
      product. We haven’t needed it yet, but it’s likely going to prove quite
      useful for you (beyond just this path-following example), so we’ll go over
      it in detail now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember all the basic vector math we covered in Chapter 1? Add, subtract,
      multiply, and divide?
    </p>

    <figure id="chapter06_figure18">
      <img alt="Figure 6.18" src="chapter06/ch06_18.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.18</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Notice how in the above diagram, vector multiplication involves
      multiplying a vector by a scalar value. This makes sense; when we want a
      vector to be twice as large (but facing the same direction), we multiply
      it by 2. When we want it to be half the size, we multiply it by 0.5.
    </p>

    <a data-primary="dot product (PVector)" data-secondary="defined" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      However, there are two other <em>multiplication-like</em> operations with
      vectors that are useful in certain scenarios—the dot product and the cross
      product. For now we’re going to focus on the dot product, which is defined
      as follows. Assume vectors <span data-type="equation">\vec{A}</span> and
      <span data-type="equation">\vec{B}</span>:
    </p>

    <div class="narrow">
      <div data-type="equation">\vec{A}=(a_x,a_y)</div>
      <div data-type="equation">\vec{B}=(b_x,b_y)</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      THE DOT PRODUCT:
      <span data-type="equation">\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}=a_x\times b_x + a_y\times b_y</span>
    </p>

    <p>For example, if we have the following two vectors:</p>

    <div class="narrow">
      <div data-type="equation">\vec{A}=(-3,5)</div>
      <div data-type="equation">\vec{B}=(10,1)</div>
    </div>

    <div data-type="equation">
      \vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = -3 * 10 + 5 * 1 = -30 + 5 = -25
    </div>

    <p>
      Notice that the result of the dot product is a scalar value (a single
      number) and not a vector.
    </p>

    <p>In p5, this would translate to:</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
const a = createVector(-3, 5);
const b = createVector(10, 1);

// The p5.Vector class includes a
// function to calculate the dot product.
const n = a.dot(b);</pre>

    <p>
      And if we were to look in the guts of the <code>p5.Vector</code> source,
      we’d find a pretty simple implementation of this function:
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
function dot(v) {
  return this.x*v.x + this.y*v.y + this.z*v.z;
}</pre>

    <p>
      This is simple enough, but why do we need the dot product, and when is it
      going to be useful for us in code?
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the more common uses of the dot product is to find the angle
      between two vectors. Another way in which the dot product can be expressed
      is:
    </p>

    <div data-type="equation">
      \vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = ||\vec{A}||\times||\vec{B}||\times\cos(\theta)
    </div>

    <a data-primary="dot product (PVector)" data-secondary="theta" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="theta (θ)" data-secondary="dot product and" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      In other words, A dot B is equal to the magnitude of A times magnitude of
      B times cosine of theta (with theta defined as
      <em>the angle between the two vectors A and B</em>).
    </p>

    <p>
      The two formulas for dot product can be derived from one another with
      <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DotProduct.html">trigonometry</a>,
      but for our purposes we can be happy with operating on the assumption
      that:
    </p>

    <div class="narrow">
      <div data-type="equation">
        \vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = ||\vec{A}||\times||\vec{B}||\times\cos(\theta)
      </div>
      <div data-type="equation">
        \vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}=a_x\times b_x + a_y\times b_y
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>both hold true and therefore:</p>

    <div data-type="equation">
      a_x\times b_x + a_y\times
      b_y=||\vec{A}||\times||\vec{B}||\times\cos(\theta)
    </div>

    <figure class="half-width-right" id="chapter06_figure19">
      <img alt="Figure 6.19" src="chapter06/ch06_19.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.19</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Now, let’s start with the following problem. We have the vectors A and B:
    </p>

    <div class="narrow">
      <div data-type="equation">\vec{A}=(10,2)</div>
      <div data-type="equation">\vec{B}=(4,-3)</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      We now have a situation in which we know everything except for theta. We
      know the components of the vector and can calculate the magnitude of each
      vector. We can therefore solve for cosine of theta:
    </p>

    <div data-type="equation">
      \cos(\theta)=(\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}) / (||\vec{A}||\times||\vec{B}||)
    </div>

    <p>
      To solve for theta, we can take the inverse cosine (often expressed as
      <em>cosine<sup>-1</sup></em> or <em>arccosine</em>).
    </p>

    <div data-type="equation">
      \theta=\cos^{-1}((\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}) / (||\vec{A}||\times||\vec{B}||))
    </div>

    <p>Let’s now do the math with actual numbers:</p>

    <div class="narrow">
      <div data-type="equation">||\vec{A}||=10.2</div>
      <div data-type="equation">||\vec{B}||=5</div>
    </div>

    <p>Therefore:</p>

    <div class="narrow">
      <div data-type="equation">
        \theta=\cos^{-1}((10\times4+2\times-3)/(10.2\times5))
      </div>
      <div data-type="equation">\theta=\cos^{-1}(34/51)</div>
      <div data-type="equation">\theta=\sim48^\circ</div>
    </div>

    <p>The p5 version of this would be:</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
const a = createVector(10, 2);
const b = createVector(4, -3);
const theta = acos(a.dot(b) / (a.mag() * b.mag()));</pre>

    <p>
      And, again, if we were to dig into the guts of the p5 source code,
      we would see a function that implements this exact algorithm.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  function angleBetween(v1, v2) {
    const dot = v1.dot(v2);
    const theta = Math.acos(dot / (v1.mag() * v2.mag()));
    return theta;
  }</pre>

    <p>
      Now that we’ve got a basic understanding of the dot product under our
      belt, we can return to a discussion of Craig Reynolds’s path-following
      algorithm. Let’s quickly clarify something. We are talking about path
      <em>following</em>, not path <em>finding</em>. Pathfinding refers to a
      research topic (commonly studied in artificial intelligence) that involves
      solving for the shortest distance between two points, often in a maze.
      With <strong><em>path following</em></strong>, the path already exists and we’re asking a
      vehicle to follow that path.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before we work out the individual pieces, let’s take a look at the overall
      algorithm for path following, as defined by Reynolds.
    </p>

    <figure id="chapter06_figure20">
      <img alt="Figure 6.20" src="chapter06/ch06_20.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.20</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <a data-primary="path" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      We’ll first define what we mean by a path. There are many ways we could
      implement a path, but for us, a simple way will be to define a path as a
      series of connected points:
    </p>

    <figure id="chapter06_figure21">
      <img alt="Figure 6.21: Path" src="chapter06/ch06_21.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.21: Path&nbsp;</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>An even simpler path would be a line between two points.</p>

    <figure id="chapter06_figure22">
      <img alt="Figure 6.22: Simple path" src="chapter06/ch06_22.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.22: Simple path&nbsp;</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      We’re also going to consider a path to have a radius. If we think of the
      path as a road, the radius determines the road’s width. With a smaller
      radius, our vehicles will have to follow the path more closely; a wider
      radius will allow them to stray a bit more.
    </p>

    <p>Putting this into a class, we have:</p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img alt="ch06 ex5 a" src="chapter06/ch06_ex5_a.png" />
      <figcaption>ch06 ex5 a&nbsp;</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Path {

  constructor() {
    // A path has a radius, i.e. how wide it is.
    //{!3} Picking some arbitrary values to initialize the path
    this.radius = 20;
    this.start = createVector(0, height/3);
    //{!2} A path is only two points, start and end.
    this.end = createVector(width, 2*height/3);
  }

  //{!7} Display the path.
  display() {
    strokeWeight(this.radius*2);
    stroke(0, 100);
    line(this.start.x, this.start.y, this.end.x, this.end.y);
    strokeWeight(1);
    stroke(0);
    line(this.start.x, this.start.y, this.end.x, this.end.y);
  }
}</pre>

    <p>
      Now, let’s assume we have a vehicle (as depicted below) outside of the
      path’s radius, moving with a velocity.
    </p>

    <figure id="chapter06_figure23">
      <img alt="Figure 6.23" src="chapter06/ch06_23.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.23</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The first thing we want to do is predict, assuming a constant velocity,
      where that vehicle will be in the future.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
// Start by making a copy of the velocity.
const predict = vel.copy();

//{!2} Normalize it and look 25 pixels
// ahead by scaling the vector up.
predict.normalize();
predict.mult(25);

// Add vector to position to find the
// predicted position.
const predictLoc = p5.Vector.add(this.position, predict);</pre>

    <a data-primary="path following" data-secondary="current distance from path"
      data-tertiary="finding" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Once we have that position, it’s now our job to find out the vehicle’s
      current distance from the path of that predicted position. If it’s very
      far away, well, then, we’ve strayed from the path and need to steer back
      towards it. If it’s close, then we’re doing OK and are following the path
      nicely.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, how do we find the distance between a point and a line? This concept
      is key. The distance between a point and a line is defined as the length
      of the normal between that point and line. The normal is a vector that
      extends from that point and is perpendicular to the line.
    </p>

    <figure id="chapter06_figure24">

      <figcaption>Figure 6.24</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Let’s figure out what we do know. We know we have a vector (call it
      <span data-type="equation">\vec{A}</span>) that extends from the path’s
      starting point to the vehicle’s predicted position.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
const a = p5.Vector.sub(predictLoc, path.start);</pre>

    <p>
      We also know that we can define a vector (call it
      <span data-type="equation">\vec{B}</span>) that points from the start of
      the path to the end.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
const b = p5.Vector.sub(path.end, path.start);</pre>

    <p>
      Now, with basic trigonometry, we know that the distance from the path’s
      start to the normal point is:
      <span class="formula">|A| * cos(theta)</span>.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Figure 6.25</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      If we knew theta, we could easily define that normal point as follows:
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
//{!1} The distance from START to NORMAL
const d = a.mag() * cos(theta);
b.normalize();
// Scale PVector b to that distance.
b.mult(d);
// The normal point can be found by adding
// the scaled version of b to the path’s
// starting point.
const normalPoint = p5.Vector.add(path.start, b);</pre>

    <p>
      And if the dot product has taught us anything, it’s that given two
      vectors, we can get theta, the angle between.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
// What is theta?  The angle between A and B
const theta = p5.Vector.angleBetween(a, b);
b.normalize();
b.mult(a.mag() * cos(theta));
const normalPoint = p5.Vector.add(path.start, b);</pre>

    <p>
      While the above code will work, there’s one more simplification we can
      make. If you’ll notice, the desired magnitude for vector
      <span data-type="equation">\vec{B}</span> is:
    </p>

    <p><span class="formula">a.mag() * cos(theta)</span></p>

    <p>which is the code translation of:</p>

    <div data-type="equation">||\vec{A}||\times\cos(\theta)</div>

    <p>And if you recall:</p>

    <div data-type="equation">
      \vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}=||\vec{A}||\times||\vec{B}||\times\cos(\theta)
    </div>

    <p>Now, what if vector {vectorb} is a unit vector, i.e. length 1? Then:</p>

    <div data-type="equation">
      \vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}=||\vec{A}||\times1\times\cos(\theta)
    </div>

    <p>or</p>

    <div data-type="equation">
      \vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}=||\vec{A}||\times\cos(\theta)
    </div>

    <p>And what are we doing in our code? Normalizing b!</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
b.normalize();</pre>

    <p>Because of this fact, we can simplify our code as:</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
//{{!1} .line-through}
const theta = p5.Vector.angleBetween(a, b);

b.normalize();
// We can use the dot product to scale b’s length.
b.mult(a.dot(b));

const normalPoint = p5.Vector.add(path.start, b);</pre>

    <a data-primary="scalar projection" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      This process is commonly known as “scalar projection.”
      <strong><em>|A| cos(&theta;) is the scalar projection of A onto B.</em></strong>

      Once we have the normal point along the path, we have to decide whether
      the vehicle should steer towards the path and how. Reynolds’s algorithm
      states that the vehicle should only steer towards the path if it strays
      beyond the path (i.e., if the distance between the normal point and the
      predicted future position is greater than the path radius).
    </p>

  //{!1} We don’t have to work out the desired velocity and
  // steering force; all that is taken care of by seek(),
  // which we already wrote in Example 6.1.
  this.seek(target);
}</pre>

    <p>But what is the target?</p>

    <a data-primary="path following" data-secondary="target" data-tertiary="determining"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Reynolds’s algorithm involves picking a point ahead of the normal on the
      path (see step #3 above). But for simplicity, we could just say that the
      target is the normal itself. This will work fairly well:
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
const distance = p5.Vector.dist(predictLoc, normalPoint);
if (distance > path.radius) {
  //{!1} Seek the normal point on the path.
  this.seek(normalPoint);
}</pre>

    <p>
      Since we know the vector that defines the path (we’re calling it “B”), we
      can implement Reynolds’s “point ahead on the path” without too much
      trouble.
    </p>

  //{!1} By adding b to normalPoint, we now move

      Putting it all together, we have the following steering function in our

      Now, you may notice above that instead of using all that dot
      product/scalar projection code to find the normal point, we instead call a
      function: <code>getNormalPoint()</code>. In cases like this, it’s useful
      to break out the code that performs a specific task (finding a normal
      point) into a function that it can be used generically in any case where
      it is required. The function takes three <code>PVector</code><code>s</code>: the first defines
      a point in Cartesian space and the
      second and third arguments define a line segment.

      What do we have so far? We have a <code>Path</code> class that defines a
      path as a line between two points. We have a <code>Vehicle</code> class
      that defines a vehicle that can follow the path (using a steering behavior
      to seek a target along the path). What is missing?

      <figcaption>Figure 6.30</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      We’ve built a great example so far, yes, but it’s pretty darn limiting.
      After all, what if we want our path to be something that looks more like:
    </p>

    <figure class="Path defined as line segments" id="chapter06_figure31">
      <img alt="Figure 6.31" src="chapter06/ch06_31.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.31</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      While it’s true that we could make this example work for a curved path,
      we’re much less likely to end up needing a cool compress on our forehead
      if we stick with line segments. In the end, we can always employ the same
      technique we discovered with Box2D—we can draw whatever fancy curved path
      we want and approximate it behind the scenes with simple geometric forms.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, what’s the problem? If we made path following work with one line
      segment, how do we make it work with a series of connected line segments?
      Let’s take a look again at our vehicle driving along the screen. Say we
      arrive at Step 3.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Step 3: Find a target point on the path.</em></strong>
    </p>

    <a data-primary="normal points" data-secondary="series of" data-tertiary="for path following"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      To find the target, we need to find the normal to the line segment. But
      now that we have a series of line segments, we have a series of normal
      points (see above)! Which one do we choose? The solution we’ll employ is
      to pick the normal point that is (a) closest and (b) on the path itself.
    </p>

    <figure id="chapter06_figure32">
      <img alt="Figure 6.32" src="chapter06/ch06_32.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.32</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      If we have a point and an infinitely long line, we’ll always have a
      normal. But, as in the path-following example, if we have a point and a
      line segment, we won’t necessarily find a normal that is on the line
      segment itself. So if this happens for any of the segments, we can
      disqualify those normals. Once we are left with normals that are on the
      path itself (only two in the above diagram), we simply pick the one that
      is closest to our vehicle’s position.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to write the code for this, we’ll have to expand our
      <code>Path</code> class to have an <code>Array</code> of points
      (rather than just two, a start and an end).
    </p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img alt="ch06 ex6 a" src="chapter06/ch06_ex6_a.png" />
      <figcaption>ch06 ex6 a&nbsp;</figcaption>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
 class Path {

  constructor() {
    this.radius = 20;
    //{!1} A Path is now an ArrayList of points (PVector objects).
    this.points = [];
  }

  // This function allows us to add points to the path.
  addPoint(x, y) {
    const point = createVector(x,y);
    this.points.add(point);
  }

  //{!9} Display the path as a series of points.
  display() {
    stroke(0);
    noFill();
    beginShape();
    for (let v of this.points) {
      vertex(v.x, v.y);
    }
    endShape();
  }
}</pre>

    <p>
      Now that we have the <code>Path</code> class defined, it’s the vehicle’s
      turn to deal with multiple line segments. All we did before was find the
      normal for one line segment. We can now find the normals for all the line
      segments in a loop.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
for (int i = 0; i < p.points.length-1; i++) {
  const a = p.points[i];
  const b = p.points[i+1];
  //{!1 .offset-top} Finding the normals for each line segment
  const normalPoint = this.getNormalPoint(predictLoc, a, b);
</pre>

    <p>
      Then we should make sure the normal point is actually between points
      <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. Since we know our path goes from left
      to right in this example, we can test if the <em>x</em> component of
      <code>normalPoint</code> is outside the <em>x</em> components of
      <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
   if (normalPoint.x < a.x || normalPoint.x > b.x) {
      //{!1} Use the end point of the segment
      // as our normal point if we can’t find one.
      normalPoint = b.copy();
   }</pre>

    <p>
      As a little trick, we’ll say that if it’s not within the line segment,
      let’s just pretend the end point of that line segment is the normal. This
      will ensure that our vehicle always stays on the path, even if it strays
      out of the bounds of our line segments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, we’ll need to make sure we find the normal point that is closest
      to our vehicle. To accomplish this, we start with a very high “world
      record” distance and iterate through each normal point to see if it beats
      the record (i.e. is less than). Each time a normal point beats the record,
      the world record is updated and the winning point is stored in a variable
      named <code>target</code>. At the end of the loop, we’ll have the closest
      normal point in that variable.

      decisions about how to seek and flow and follow. But what is a life led
      alone, without the love and support of others? Our purpose here is not
      only to build individual behaviors for our vehicles, but to put our
      vehicles into systems of many vehicles and allow those vehicles to
      interact with each other.

    <p>
      Let’s think about a tiny, crawling ant—one single ant. An ant is an
      autonomous agent; it can perceive its environment (using antennae to
      gather information about the direction and strength of chemical signals)
      and make decisions about how to move based on those signals. But can a
      single ant acting alone build a nest, gather food, defend its queen? An
      ant is a simple unit and can only perceive its immediate environment. A
      colony of ants, however, is a sophisticated complex system, a
      “superorganism” in which the components work together to accomplish
      difficult and complicated goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      We want to take what we’ve learned during the process of building
      autonomous agents in p5 into simulations that involve many agents
      operating in parallel—agents that have an ability to perceive not only
      their physical environment but also the actions of their fellow agents,
      and then act accordingly. We want to create complex systems in p5.
    </p>

    <p>
      What is a complex system? A complex system is typically defined as a
      system that is “more than the sum of its parts.” While the individual
      elements of the system may be incredibly simple and easily understood, the
      behavior of the system as a whole can be highly complex, intelligent, and
      difficult to predict. Here are three key principles of complex systems.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Simple units with short-range relationships.</em></strong>
          This is what we’ve been building all along: vehicles that have a
          limited perception of their environment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Simple units operate in parallel.</em></strong> This is
          what we need to simulate in code. For every cycle through p5’s
          <code>draw()</code> loop, each unit will decide how to move (to create
          the appearance of them all working in parallel).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong><em>System as a whole exhibits emergent phenomena.</em></strong>
          Out of the interactions between these simple units emerges complex
          behavior, patterns, and intelligence. Here we’re talking about the
          result we are hoping for in our sketches. Yes, we know this happens in
          nature (ant colonies, termites, migration patterns, earthquakes,
          snowflakes, etc.), but can we achieve the same result in our
          p5 sketches?

      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Following are three additional features of complex systems that will help
      frame the discussion, as well as provide guidelines for features we will
      want to include in our software simulations. It’s important to acknowledge
      that this is a fuzzy set of characteristics and not all complex systems
      have all of them.

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Non-linearity.</em></strong> This aspect of complex
          systems is often casually referred to as “the butterfly effect,”
          coined by mathematician and meteorologist Edward Norton Lorenz, a
          pioneer in the study of chaos theory. In 1961, Lorenz was running a
          computer weather simulation for the second time and, perhaps to save a
          little time, typed in a starting value of 0.506 instead of 0.506127.
          The end result was completely different from the first result of the
          simulation. In other words, the theory is that a single butterfly
          flapping its wings on the other side of the world could cause a
          massive weather shift and ruin our weekend at the beach. We call it
          “non-linear” because there isn’t a linear relationship between a
          change in initial conditions and a change in outcome. A small change
          in initial conditions can have a massive effect on the outcome.
          Non-linear systems are a superset of chaotic systems. In the next
          chapter, we’ll see how even in a system of many zeros and ones, if we
          change just one bit, the result will be completely different.

          <strong><em>Competition and cooperation.</em></strong> One of the
          things that often makes a complex system tick is the presence of both
          competition and cooperation between the elements. In our upcoming
          flocking system, we will have three rules—alignment, cohesion, and
          separation. Alignment and cohesion will ask the elements to
          “cooperate”—i.e. work together to stay together and move together.
          Separation, however, will ask the elements to “compete” for space. As
          we get to the flocking system, try taking out the cooperation or the
          competition and you’ll see how you are left without complexity.
          Competition and cooperation are found in living complex systems, but
          not in non-living complex systems like the weather.

          <strong><em>Feedback.</em></strong> Complex systems often include a
          feedback loop where the output of the system is fed back into the
          system to influence its behavior in a positive or negative direction.
          Let’s say you drive to work each day because the price of gas is low.
          In fact, everyone drives to work. The price of gas goes up as demand
          begins to exceed supply. You, and everyone else, decide to take the
          train to work because driving is too expensive. And the price of gas
          declines as the demand declines. The price of gas is both the input of
          the system (determining whether you choose to drive or ride the train)
          and the output (the demand that results from your choice). I should
          note that economic models (like supply/demand, the stock market) are
          one example of a human complex system. Others include fads and trends,
          elections, crowds, and traffic flow.

      Complexity will serve as a theme for the remaining content in this book.
      In this chapter, we’ll begin by adding one more feature to our
      <code>Vehicle</code> class: an ability to look at neighboring vehicles.

    <h2>6.11 Group Behaviors (or: Let’s not run into each other)</h2>

    <a data-primary="complex systems" data-secondary="group behavior" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="group behavior" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="natural phenomena" data-secondary="group behavior" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      A group is certainly not a new concept. We’ve done this before—in Chapter
      4, where we developed a framework for managing collections of particles in
      a <code>ParticleSystem</code> class. There, we stored a list of particles
      in an <code>Array</code>. We’ll do the same thing here: store a bunch
      of <code>Vehicle</code> objects in an <code>Array</code>.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
// Declare an ArrayList of Vehicle objects.
let vehicles;

function setup() {
  //{!3} Initialize and fill the ArrayList
  // with a bunch of Vehicles.
  vehicles = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    vehicles.push(new Vehicle(random(width), random(height)));
  }
}</pre>

    <p>
      Now when it comes time to deal with all the vehicles in
      <code>draw()</code>, we simply loop through all of them and call the
      necessary functions.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
function draw(){
  for (let v of vehicles) {
    v.update();
    v.display();
  }
}</pre>

    <p>
      OK, so maybe we want to add a behavior, a force to be applied to all the
      vehicles. This could be seeking the mouse.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
    v.seek(mouseX, mouseY);</pre>

    <a data-primary="collisions" data-secondary="avoiding in group behavior"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="group behavior" data-secondary="collisions" data-tertiary="avoiding"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      But that’s an individual behavior. We’ve already spent thirty-odd pages
      worrying about individual behaviors. We’re here because we want to apply a
      group behavior. Let’s begin with separation, a behavior that commands,
      “Avoid colliding with your neighbors!”
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
    v.separate();</pre>

    <p>
      Is that right? It sounds good, but it’s not. What’s missing? In the case
      of seek, we said, “Seek <code>mouseX</code> and <code>mouseY</code>.” In
      the case of separate, we’re saying “separate from <em>everyone else</em>.”
      Who is everyone else? It’s the list of all the other vehicles.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
    v.separate(vehicles);</pre>

    <p>
      This is the big leap beyond what we did before with particle systems.
      Instead of having each element (particle or vehicle) operate on its own,
      we’re now saying, “Hey you, the vehicle! When it comes time for you to
      operate, you need to operate with an awareness of everyone else. So I’m
      going to go ahead and pass you the <code>Array</code> of everyone
      else.”
    </p>

    <p>
      This is how we’ve mapped out <code>setup()</code> and
      <code>draw()</code> to deal with a group behavior.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
let vehicles;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(320, 240);
  vehicles = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    vehicles.push(new Vehicle(random(width), random(height)));
  }
}

function draw() {
  background(255);

  for (let v of vehicles) {
    //{!1 .bold} This is really the only new thing we’re doing in this section.  We’re asking
    // a Vehicle object to examine all the other vehicles in the process of calculating a
    // separation force.
    v.separate(vehicles);
    v.update();
    v.display();
  }
}</pre>

    <a data-primary="steering behaviors" data-secondary="group behavior and"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Of course, this is just the beginning. The real work happens inside the
      <code>separate()</code> function itself. Let’s figure out how we want to
      define separation. Reynolds states: “Steer to avoid crowding.” In other
      words, if a given vehicle is too close to you, steer away from that
      vehicle. Sound familiar? Remember the seek behavior where a vehicle steers
      towards a target? Reverse that force and we have the flee behavior.
    </p>

    <figure class="half-width-right" id="chapter06_figure34">
      <img alt="Figure 6.34" src="chapter06/ch06_34.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 6.34</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      But what if more than one vehicle is too close? In this case, we’ll define
      separation as the average of all the vectors pointing away from any close
      vehicles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let’s begin to write the code. As we just worked out, we’re writing a
      function called <code>separate()</code> that receives an
      <code>Array</code> of Vehicle objects as an argument.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
separate (vehicles) {

}</pre>

    <p>
      Inside this function, we’re going to loop through all of the vehicles and
      see if any are too close.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  // This variable specifies how close is too close.
  const desiredseparation = 20;

  for (let other of vehicles) {

    //{!1 .offset} What is the distance between me and another Vehicle?
    const d = p5.Vector.dist(this.position, other.position);

    if ((d > 0) && (d < desiredseparation)) {
      // Any code here will be executed if the Vehicle is within 20 pixels.

    }
  }</pre>

    <p>
      Notice how in the above code, we are not only checking if the distance is
      less than a desired separation (i.e. too close!), but also if the distance
      is greater than zero. This is a little trick that makes sure we don’t ask
      a vehicle to separate from itself. Remember, all the vehicles are in the
      <code>ArrayList</code>, so if you aren’t careful you’ll be comparing each
      vehicle to itself!
    </p>

    <p>
      Once we know that two vehicles are too close, we need to make a vector
      that points away from the offending vehicle.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
    if ((d > 0) && (d < desiredseparation)) {
      //{!2 .offset} A PVector pointing away from the other’s position
      const diff = p5.Vector.sub(this.position, other.position);
      diff.normalize();
    }</pre>

    <p>
      This is not enough. We have that vector now, but we need to make sure we
      calculate the average of all vectors pointing away from close vehicles.
      How do we compute average? We add up all the vectors and divide by the
      total.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  //{!1 .bold} Start with an empty PVector.
  let sum = createVector();
	//{.bold}
  let count = 0;
  // We have to keep track of how many Vehicles are too close.
  for (let other of vehicles) {

    const d = p5.Vector.dist(this.position, other.position);
    if ((d > 0) && (d < desiredseparation)) {
			//{!1 .bold}
      const diff = p5.Vector.sub(this.position, other.position);
      diff.normalize();
      //{!1 .bold} Add all the vectors together and increment the count.
      sum.add(diff);
      count++;
    }
  }

  //{!1 .bold} We have to make sure we found at least one close
  // vehicle.  We don’t want to bother doing anything
  // if nothing is too close (not to mention we can’t
  // divide by zero!)
  if (count > 0) {
		//{.bold}
    sum.div(count);
  }</pre>

    <p>
      Once we have the average vector (stored in the <code>p5.Vector</code> object
      “sum”), that <code>p5.Vector</code> can be scaled to maximum speed and
      become our desired velocity—we <em>desire</em> to move in that direction
      at maximum speed! (In fact, we don't have to divide by count anymore since
      we are manually setting the magnitude.) And once we have the desired
      velocity, it’s the same old Reynolds story: steering equals desired minus
      velocity.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  if (count > 0) {
    //{!1} Scale average to maxspeed
    // (this becomes desired).
    sum.setMag(this.maxspeed);

    //{!1} Reynolds’s steering formula
    const steer = p5.Vector.sub(sum, vel);
    steer.limit(this.maxforce);

    //{!1} Apply the force to the Vehicle’s
    // acceleration.
    this.applyForce(steer);
  }</pre>

    <p>
      Let’s see the function in its entirety. There are two additional
      improvements, noted in the code comments.

      The previous two exercises hint at what is perhaps the most important
      aspect of this chapter. After all, what is a p5 sketch with one
      steering force compared to one with many? How could we even begin to
      simulate emergence in our sketches with only one rule? The most exciting
      and intriguing behaviors will come from mixing and matching multiple
      steering forces, and we’ll need a mechanism for doing so.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may be thinking, “Duh, this is nothing new. We do this all the time.”
      You would be right. In fact, we did this as early as Chapter 2.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  const wind = createVector(0.001, 0);
  const gravity = createVector(0, 0.1);
  mover.applyForce(wind);
  mover.applyForce(gravity);</pre>

    <p>
      Here we have a mover that responds to two forces. This all works nicely
      because of the way we designed the <code>Mover</code> class to accumulate
      the force vectors into its acceleration vector. In this chapter, however,
      our forces stem from internal desires of the movers (now called vehicles).
      And those desires can be weighted. Let’s consider a sketch where all
      vehicles have two desires:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Seek the mouse position.</em></strong>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Separate from any vehicles that are too close.</em></strong>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We might begin by adding a function to the <code>Vehicle</code> class that
      manages all of the behaviors. Let’s call it <code>applyBehaviors()</code>.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
applyBehaviors(vehicles) {
  this.separate(vehicles);
  this.seek(createVector(mouseX, mouseY));
}</pre>

    <p>
      Here we see how a single function takes care of calling the other
      functions that apply the forces—<code>separate()</code> and
      <code>seek()</code>. We could start mucking around with those functions
      and see if we can adjust the strength of the forces they are calculating.
      But it would be easier for us to ask those functions to return the forces
      so that we can adjust their strength before applying them to the vehicle’s
      acceleration.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  applyBehaviors(vehicles) {
    const separate = this.separate(vehicles);
    const seek = this.seek(createVector(mouseX,mouseY));
    //{!2} We have to apply the force here since seek() and separate() no longer do so.
    this.applyForce(separate);
    this.applyForce(seek);
  }</pre>

    <p>Let’s look at how the seek function changed.</p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  seek(target) {
    const desired = p5.Vector.sub(target,loc);
    desired.normalize();
    desired.mult(this.maxspeed);
    const steer = p5.Vector.sub(desired,vel);
    steer.limit(this.maxforce);

    //{!1 .line-through}
    this.applyForce(steer);
		//{!1} Instead of applying the force we return the PVector.
    return steer;
  }</pre>

    <p>
      This is a subtle change, but incredibly important for us: it allows us to
      alter the strength of these forces in one place.

    <p>
      Flocking is a group animal behavior that is characteristic of many living
      creatures, such as birds, fish, and insects. In 1986, Craig Reynolds
      created a computer simulation of flocking behavior and documented the
      algorithm in his paper, “Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed
      Behavioral Model.” Recreating this simulation in p5 will bring
      together all the concepts in this chapter.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>We will use the steering force formula (steer = desired - velocity)
            to implement the rules of flocking.</em>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>These steering forces will be group behaviors and require each
            vehicle to look at all the other vehicles.</em>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>We will combine and weight multiple forces.</em></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>The result will be a complex system—intelligent group behavior will
            emerge from the simple rules of flocking without the presence of a
            centralized system or leader.</em>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The good news is, we’ve already done items 1 through 3 in this chapter, so
      this section will be about just putting it all together and seeing the
      result.

    <p>
      Before we begin, I should mention that we’re going to change the name of
      our <code>Vehicle</code> class (yet again). Reynolds uses the term “boid”
      (a made-up word that refers to a bird-like object) to describe the
      elements of a flocking system and we will do the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just as we did with our separate and seek example, we’ll want our
      <code>Boid</code> objects to have a single function that manages all the
      above behaviors. We’ll call this function <code>flock()</code>.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  flock(boids) {
    //{!3} The three flocking rules
    const sep = this.separate(boids);
    const ali = this.align(boids);
    const coh = this.cohesion(boids);

    //{!3} Arbitrary weights for these forces
    // (Try different ones!)
    sep.mult(1.5);
    ali.mult(1.0);
    coh.mult(1.0);

    //{!3} Applying all the forces
    this.applyForce(sep);
    this.applyForce(ali);
    this.applyForce(coh);
  }</pre>

    <p>
      Now, it’s just a matter of implementing the three rules. We did separation
      before; it’s identical to our previous example. Let’s take a look at
      alignment, or steering in the same direction as your neighbors. As with
      all of our steering behaviors, we’ve got to boil down this concept into a
      desire: the boid’s desired velocity is the average velocity of its
      neighbors.
    </p>

    <p>
      So our algorithm is to calculate the average velocity of all the other
      boids and set that to desired.

    const sum = createVector(0,0);
    for (let other of boids) {
      sum.add(other.velocity);
    }
    sum.div(boids.length);

    // We desire to go in that
    // direction at maximum speed.
    sum.setMag(this.maxspeed);

    //{!3} Reynolds’s steering
    // force formula
    const steer = p5.Vector.sub(sum,velocity);
    steer.limit(this.maxforce);
    return steer;

    <p>
      The above is pretty good, but it’s missing one rather crucial detail. One
      of the key principles behind complex systems like flocking is that the
      elements (in this case, boids) have short-range relationships. Thinking
      about ants again, it’s pretty easy to imagine an ant being able to sense
      its immediate environment, but less so an ant having an awareness of what
      another ant is doing hundreds of feet away. The fact that the ants can
      perform such complex collective behavior from only these neighboring
      relationships is what makes them so exciting in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
      In our alignment function, we’re taking the average velocity of all the
      boids, whereas we should really only be looking at the boids within a
      certain distance. That distance threshold is up to you, of course. You
      could design boids that can see only twenty pixels away or boids that can
      see a hundred pixels away.

    <p>
      Much like we did with separation (only calculating a force for others
      within a certain distance), we’ll want to do the same with alignment (and
      cohesion).

      It’s also worth taking the time to write a class called

      change: When we call <code>run()</code> on each <code>Boid</code> object

    <h2>6.14 Algorithmic Efficiency (or: Why does my $@(*%! run so slowly?)</h2>

    <a data-primary="efficiency" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="performance" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      I would like to hide the dark truth behind we’ve just done, because I
      would like you to be happy and live a fulfilling and meaningful life. But
      I also would like to be able to sleep at night without worrying about you
      so much. So it is with a heavy heart that I must bring up this topic.
      Group behaviors are wonderful. But they can be slow, and the more elements
      in the group, the slower they can be. Usually, when we talk about
      p5 sketches running slowly, it’s because drawing to the screen can
      be slow—the more you draw, the slower your sketch runs. This is actually a
      case, however, where the slowness derives from the algorithm itself. Let’s
      discuss.
    </p>

    <a data-primary="Big O Notation" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="efficiency" data-secondary="Big O Notation" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="flocking" data-secondary="performance and" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="performance" data-secondary="Big O Notation" data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Computer scientists classify algorithms with something called “Big O
      notation,” which describes the efficiency of an algorithm: how many
      computational cycles does it require to complete? Let’s consider a simple
      analog search problem. You have a basket containing one hundred chocolate
      treats, only one of which is pure dark chocolate. That’s the one you want
      to eat. To find it, you pick the chocolates out of the basket one by one.
      Sure, you might be lucky and find it on the first try, but in the
      worst-case scenario you have to check all one hundred before you find the
      dark chocolate. To find one thing in one hundred, you have to check one
      hundred things (or to find one thing in N things, you have to check N
      times.) Your Big O Notation is N. This, incidentally, is the Big O
      Notation that describes our simple particle system. If we have N
      particles, we have to run and display those particles N times.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, let’s think about a group behavior (such as flocking). For every
      <code>Boid</code> object, we have to check every other
      <code>Boid</code> object (for its velocity and position). Let’s say we
      have one hundred boids. For boid #1, we need to check one hundred boids;
      for boid #2, we need to check one hundred boids, and so on and so forth.
      For one hundred boids, we need to perform one hundred times one hundred
      checks, or ten thousand. No problem: computers are fast and can do things
      ten thousand times pretty easily. Let’s try one thousand.
    </p>

    <p>1,000 x 1,000 = 1,000,000 cycles.</p>

    <p>
      OK, this is rather slow, but still somewhat manageable. Let’s try 10,000
      elements:
    </p>

    <p>10,000 x 10,000 elements = 100,000,000 cycles.</p>

    <p>Now, we’re really getting slow. Really, really, really slow.</p>

    <a data-primary="Big O Notation N-Squared" data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="efficiency" data-secondary="Big O Notation N-Squared"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>
    <a data-primary="performance" data-secondary="Big O Notation N-Squared"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      Notice something odd? As the number of elements increases by a factor of
      10, the number of required cycles increases by a factor of 100. Or as the
      number of elements increases by a factor of N, the cycles increase by a
      factor of N times N. This is known as Big O Notation N-Squared.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know what you are thinking. You are thinking: “No problem; with
      flocking, we only need to consider the boids that are close to other
      boids. So even if we have 1,000 boids, we can just look at, say, the 5
      closest boids and then we only have 5,000 cycles.” You pause for a moment,
      and then start thinking: “So for each boid I just need to check all the
      boids and find the five closest ones and I’m good!” See the catch-22? Even
      if we only want to look at the close ones, the only way to know what the
      close ones are would be to check all of them.
    </p>

    <p>Or is there another way?</p>

    <p>
      Let’s take a number that we might actually want to use, but would still
      run too slowly: 2,000 (4,000,000 cycles required).
    </p>

    <p>
      What if we could divide the screen into a grid? We would take all 2,000
      boids and assign each boid to a cell within that grid. We would then be
      able to look at each boid and compare it to its neighbors within that cell
      at any given moment. Imagine a 10 x 10 grid. In a system of 2,000
      elements, on average, approximately 20 elements would be found in each
      cell (20 x 10 x 10 = 2,000). Each cell would then require 20 x 20 = 400
      cycles. With 100 cells, we’d have 100 x 400 = 40,000 cycles, a massive
      savings over 4,000,000.

    <a data-primary="Interaction with Groups of Autonomous Characters (Reynolds)"
      data-type="indexterm"></a>

    <p>
      This technique is known as “bin-lattice spatial subdivision” and is
      outlined in more detail in (surprise, surprise) Reynolds’s 2000 paper,
      <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/2000/pip.pdf">“Interaction with Groups of Autonomous
        Characters”</a>. How do we implement such an algorithm in p5? One way is to keep
      multiple <code>Array</code><code>s</code>. One
      <code>Array</code> would keep track of all the boids, just like in our
      flocking example.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
let boids;</pre>

    <p>
      In addition to that <code>Array</code>, we store an additional
      reference to each <code>Boid</code> object in a two-dimensional
      <code>Array</code>. For each cell in the grid, there is an
      <code>Array</code> that tracks the objects in that cell.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
let grid;</pre>

    <p>
      In the main <code>draw()</code> loop, each <code>Boid</code> object then
      registers itself in the appropriate cell according to its position.
    </p>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
const column = int(boid.x) / this.resolution;
const row    = int(boid.y) / this.resolution;
grid[column][row] = boid;</pre>

    <p>
      Then when it comes time to have the boids check for neighbors, they can
      look at only those in their particular cell (in truth, we also need to
      check neighboring cells to deal with border cases).
    </p>

    <div data-type="example">
      <h5>Example 6.10: Bin-lattice spatial subdivision</h5>
    </div>

    <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
const column = int(boid.x) / this.resolution;
const row    = int(boid.y) / this.resolution;
// Instead of looking at all
// the boids, just this cell
boid.flock(grid[column][row]);</pre>

    <p>
      We’re only covering the basics here; for the full code, check the book’s
      website.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, there are certainly flaws with this system. What if all the boids
      congregate in the corner and live in the same cell? Then don’t we have to
      check all 2,000 against all 2,000?
    </p>

    <p>
      The good news is that this need for optimization is a common one and there
      are a wide variety of similar techniques out there. For us, it’s likely
      that a basic approach will be good enough (in most cases, you won’t need
      one at all.) For another, more sophisticated approach, check out

      This is something of a momentous occasion. The end of Chapter 6 marks the
      end of our story of motion (in the context of this book, that is). We
      started with the concept of a vector, moved on to forces, designed systems
      of many elements, examined physics libraries, built entities with hopes
      and dreams and fears, and simulated emergence. The story doesn’t end here,
      but it does take a bit of a turn. The next two chapters won’t focus on
      moving bodies, but rather on systems of rules. Before we get there, I have
      a few quick items I’d like to mention that are important when working with
      the examples in Chapters 1 through 6. They also relate to optimizing your
      code, which fits in with the previous section.

      <h3>1) Magnitude squared (or sometimes distance squared)</h3>

      <p>
        What is magnitude squared and when should you use it? Let’s revisit how
        the magnitude of a vector is calculated.
      </p>

      <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
function mag() {
  return sqrt(x*x + y*y);
}</pre>

      <p>
        Magnitude requires the square root operation. And it should. After all,
        if you want the magnitude of a vector, then you’ve got to look up the
        Pythagorean theorem and compute it (we did this in Chapter 1). However,
        if you could somehow skip using the square root, your code would run
        faster. Let’s consider a situation where you just want to know the
        relative magnitude of a vector. For example, is the magnitude greater
        than ten? (Assume a <code>PVector</code> <code>v</code>.)
      </p>

      <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
if (v.mag() > 10) {
  // Do Something!
}</pre>

      <p>Well, this is equivalent to saying:</p>

      <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
if (v.magSq() > 100) {

        Same as magnitude, but without the square root. In the case of a single
        <code>p5.Vector</code> object, this will never make a significant
        difference on a p5 sketch. However, if you are computing the
        magnitude of thousands of <code>p5.Vector</code> objects each time through
        <code>draw()</code>, using <code>magSq()</code> instead of
        <code>mag()</code> could help your code run a wee bit faster.

        There’s a pattern here. What kinds of functions are slow to compute?
        Square root. Sine. Cosine. Tangent. Again, if you just need a sine or
        cosine value here or there in your code, you are never going to run into
        a problem. But what if you had something like this?
      </p>

      <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
function draw() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
    print(sin(PI));
  }
}</pre>

      <p>
        Sure, this is a totally ridiculous code snippet that you would never
        write. But it illustrates a certain point. If you are calculating the
        sine of pi ten thousand times, why not just calculate it once, save that
        value, and refer to it whenever necessary? This is the principle behind
        sine and cosine lookup tables. Instead of calling the sine and cosine
        functions in your code whenever you need them, you can build an array
        that stores the results of sine and cosine at angles between 0 and
        <code>TWO_PI</code> and just look up the values when you need them. For
        example, here are two arrays that store the sine and cosine values for
        every angle, 0 to 359 degrees.
      </p>

      <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
let sinvalues = [];
let cosvalues = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 360; i++) {
  sinvalues[i] = sin(radians(i));
  cosvalues[i] = cos(radians(i));
}</pre>

      <p>Now, what if you need the value of sine of pi?</p>

      <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
const angle = int(degrees(PI));
const answer = sinvalues[angle];</pre>

      <p>
        A more sophisticated example of this technique is available on the

      <a data-primary="performance" data-secondary="temporary objects and"
        data-type="indexterm"></a>

      <p>
        I have to admit, I am perhaps the biggest culprit of this last note. In
        fact, in the interest of writing clear and understandable examples, I
        often choose to make extra <code>p5.Vector</code> objects when I
        absolutely do not need to. For the most part, this is not a problem at
        all. But sometimes, it can be. Let’s take a look at an example.
      </p>

      <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
function draw() {
  for (let v of vehicles) {
   const mouse = createVector(mouseX, mouseY);
   v.seek(mouse);
  }
}</pre>

      <p>
        Let’s say our <code>Array</code> of vehicles has one thousand
        vehicles in it. We just made one thousand new
        <code>p5.Vector</code> objects every single time through
        <code>draw()</code>. Now, on any ol’ laptop or desktop computer you’ve
        purchased in recent times, your sketch will likely not register a
        complaint, run slowly, or have any problems. After all, you’ve got tons
        of RAM, and JavaScript will be able to handle making a thousand or so
        temporary objects and dispose of them without much of a problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your numbers grow larger (and they easily could) you will almost
        certainly run into a problem. In cases like this you want to look for
        ways to reduce the number of <code>p5.Vector</code> objects you make. An
        obvious fix for the above code is:
      </p>

      <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
function draw() {
  const mouse = createVector(mouseX, mouseY);
  for (let v of vehicles) {
   v.seek(mouse);
  }
}</pre>

      <p>
        Now you’ve made just one <code>p5.Vector</code> instead of one thousand.
        Even better, you could turn the <code>p5.Vector</code> into a global
        variable and just assign the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> value:
      </p>

      <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
const mouse = createVector();

function draw() {
  mouse.x = mouseX;
  mouse.y = mouseY;
  for (let v of vehicles) {
   v.seek(mouse);
  }
}</pre>

      <p>
        Now you never make a new <code>p5.Vector</code>; you use just one over the
        length of your sketch!
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the book’s examples, you can find lots of opportunities to
        reduce the number of temporary objects. Let’s look at one more. Here is
        a snippet from our <code>seek()</code> function.
      </p>

      <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
    const desired = p5.Vector.sub(target, this.position);
    desired.normalize();
    desired.mult(this.maxspeed);

    //{!1 .bold} Create a new p5.Vector to store the steering force.
    const steer = p5.Vector.sub(desired,this.velocity);
    steer.limit(this.maxforce);
    return steer;</pre>

      <p>
        See how we’ve made two <code>p5.Vector</code> objects? First, we figure
        out the desired vector, then we calculate the steering force. Notice how
        we could rewrite this to create only one <code>p5.Vector</code>.
      </p>

      <pre data-code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
    const desired = p5.Vector.sub(target, this.position);
    desired.normalize();
    desired.mult(this.maxspeed);

    //{!3 .bold} Calculate the steering force in the desired PVector.
    desired.sub(this.velocity);
    desired.limit(this.maxforce);
    return desired;</pre>

      <p>
        We don’t actually need a second <code>p5.Vector</code> called
        <code>steer</code>. We could just use the desired
        <code>p5.Vector</code> object and turn it into the steering force by
        subtracting velocity. I didn’t do this in my example because it is more
        confusing to read. But in some cases, it may be greatly more efficient.

        <p>Step 6 Exercise:</p>

        <p>
          Use the concept of steering forces to drive the behavior of the
          creatures in your ecosystem. Some possibilities:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Create “schools” or “flocks” of creatures.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Use a seeking behavior for creatures to search for food (for
              chasing moving prey, consider “pursuit”).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Use a flow field for the ecosystem environment. For example, how
              does your system behave if the creatures live in a flowing river?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Build a creature with countless steering behaviors (as many as you
              can reasonably add). Think about ways to vary the weights of these
              behaviors so that you can dial those behaviors up and down, mixing
              and matching on the fly. How are creatures’ initial weights set?
              What rules drive how the weights change over time?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Complex systems can be nested. Can you design a single creature
              out of a flock of boids? And can you then make a flock of those
              creatures?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Complex systems can have memory (and be adaptive). Can the history
              of your ecosystem affect the behavior in its current state? (This
              could be the driving force behind how the creatures adjust their
              steering force weights.)
